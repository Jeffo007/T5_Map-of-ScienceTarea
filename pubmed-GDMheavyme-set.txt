AB  - A meta-analysis of the association of iron overload with gestational diabetes 
      mellitus (GDM) may inform the health debate. We performed a meta-analysis 
      investigating the association of iron biomarkers and dietary iron exposure with GDM. 
      We identified 33 eligible studies (N = 44,110) published in 2001⁻2017. The 
      standardized mean differences (SMD) in women who had GDM compared to pregnant women 
      without were 0.25 µg/dL (95% CI: 0.001⁻0.50) for iron, 1.54 ng/mL (0.56⁻2.53) for 
      ferritin, 1.05% (0.02 to 2.08) for transferrin saturation, and 0.81 g/dL (0.40⁻1.22) 
      for hemoglobin. Adjusted odds ratio for GDM were 1.58 (95% CI: 1.20⁻2.08) for 
      ferritin, 1.30 (1.01⁻1.67) for hemoglobin, and 1.48 (1.29⁻1.69) for dietary heme 
      intake. We did not find any differences in TIBC or transferrin concentration in 
      women with and without GDM. We also did not find any association of increased 
      transferrin receptor or increased intake of total dietary iron, non-heme iron or 
      supplemental iron, with increased odds ratios for GDM. Considerable heterogeneity 
      was present among the studies (0⁻99%), but no evidence of publication bias. 
      Accumulating evidence suggests that circulating and dietary iron biomarkers among 
      pregnant women are associated with GDM, but the results should be interpreted with 
      caution due to the high heterogeneity of analyses. Randomized trials investigating 
      the benefits of iron reduction in women at high risk for GDM are warranted.

AB  - Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to iron deficiency and related adverse 
      pregnancy outcomes and, as such, are routinely recommended for iron supplementation. 
      Emerging evidence from both animal and population-based studies, however, has raised 
      potential concerns because significant associations have been observed between 
      greater iron stores and disturbances in glucose metabolism, including increased risk 
      of type 2 diabetes among nonpregnant individuals. Yet, the evidence is uncertain 
      regarding the role of iron in the development of gestational diabetes mellitus 
      (GDM), a common pregnancy complication which has short-term and long-term adverse 
      health ramifications for both women and their children. In this review, we 
      critically and systematically evaluate available data examining the risk of GDM 
      associated with dietary iron, iron supplementation, and iron status as measured by 
      blood concentrations of several indicators. We also discuss major methodologic 
      concerns regarding the available epidemiologic studies on iron and GDM.

TI  - The effects of magnesium-zinc-calcium-vitamin D co-supplementation on biomarkers of 
      inflammation, oxidative stress and pregnancy outcomes in gestational diabetes.
PG  - 107

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes is the most common medical condition in pregnant women and its 
      complications affect both mother and fetus. The beneficial effects of vitamin D on 
      gestational diabetes have been shown, though data on the effects of 
      co-administration of vitamin D with other nutrients on pregnancy outcomes in 
      gestational diabetes (GDM) are scarce. This study was aimed to determine the effects 
      of magnesium-zinc-calcium-vitamin D co-supplementation on parameters of inflammation 
      and oxidative stress, and pregnancy outcomes among women with GDM. METHODS: This 
      randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 60 women with 
      GDM not taking oral hypoglycemic agents. Patients were randomly assigned to take 
      magnesium-zinc-calcium-vitamin D supplements (n = 30) or placebo (n = 30) for 
      6 weeks. Fasting blood samples were collected from participants at baseline and 
      after the 6-week intervention to measure related biomarkers. RESULTS: 
      Magnesium-zinc-calcium-vitamin D co-supplementation resulted in a significant 
      reduction in serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (- 1.2 ± 3.5 vs. 
      + 0.8 ± 2.0 mg/L, P = 0.01) and plasma malondialdehyde concentrations (- 0.3 ± 0.3 
      vs. + 0.3 ± 1.1 μmol/L, P = 0.003), as well as a significant increase in total 
      antioxidant capacity levels (+ 38.2 ± 76.5 vs. -16.3 ± 93.5 mmol/L, P = 0.01), 
      compared to placebo. We found a decreasing trend in newborns' weight (3089.8 ± 519.9 
      vs. 3346.3 ± 411.1 g, P = 0.05) and the rate of macrosomia (3.3% vs. 16.7%, 
      P = 0.08) in the magnesium-zinc-calcium-vitamin D supplemented women. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Overall, the findings of this study have demonstrated that 
      magnesium-zinc-calcium-vitamin D co-supplementation for 6 weeks to women with GDM 
      may reduce biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress. This study was 
      retrospectively registered on 25 April 2017 in the Iranian website ( www.irct.ir ) 
      for clinical trials registration ( http://www.irct.ir : IRCT201704225623N109).

TI  - The Relationship Between Heavy Metal Exposure, Trace Element Level, and Monocyte to 
      HDL Cholesterol Ratio with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.
PG  - 1306-1315
LID - 10.1007/s12011-020-02499-9 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study is to assess the levels of heavy metals (cadmium, lead, 
      antimony, mercury, and arsenic), which are also called endocrine-disrupting 
      chemicals, and trace elements (chromium-III, chromium-VI, zinc, copper, and 
      selenium) vs. monocyte to HDL ratio among pregnant women with gestational diabetes 
      mellitus (GDM). A total of 112 pregnant women (60 with GDM and 52 healthy women) 
      were included in this case-control study. Analysis of heavy metals and trace 
      elements were performed in inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Heavy 
      metals (cadmium, lead, antimony, mercury, and arsenic), trace elements 
      (chromium-III, chromium-VI, zinc, copper, and selenium), and metabolic parameters 
      were assessed in both groups. It was determined that the levels of cadmium, lead, 
      antimony, and copper were higher (p < 0.05) and levels of chromium-III, zinc, and 
      selenium were lower (p < 0.05) among the GDM group compared to the control group, 
      whereas there was a statistically insignificant difference between the two groups, 
      regarding the levels of copper, mercury, and arsenic (p > 0.05). Moreover, the 
      monocyte to HDL ratio was higher in the GDM group (p < 0.05), and the insulin 
      resistance was significantly higher as well (p < 0.05). The results of our study 
      demonstrated that environmental factors could be effective in the etiology of GDM. 
      Toxic heavy metals, through inducing Cu, OS, and chronic inflammation, and other 
      trace elements, either directly by impacting insulin secretion or through weakening 
      the body's antioxidant defense system, could play a role in the occurrence of GDM.

LID - 641
AB  - Adequate zinc stores in the body are extremely important during periods of 
      accelerated growth. However, zinc deficiency is common in developing countries and 
      low maternal circulating zinc concentrations have previously been associated with 
      pregnancy complications. We reviewed current literature assessing circulating zinc 
      and dietary zinc intake during pregnancy and the associations with preeclampsia 
      (PE); spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB); low birthweight (LBW); and gestational 
      diabetes (GDM). Searches of MEDLINE; CINAHL and Scopus databases identified 639 
      articles and 64 studies were reviewed. In 10 out of 16 studies a difference was 
      reported with respect to circulating zinc between women who gave birth to a LBW 
      infant (≤2500 g) and those who gave birth to an infant of adequate weight (>2500 g), 
      particularly in populations where inadequate zinc intake is prevalent. In 16 of our 
      33 studies an association was found between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and 
      circulating zinc; particularly in women with severe PE (blood pressure ≥160/110 
      mmHg). No association between maternal zinc status and sPTB or GDM was seen; 
      however; direct comparisons between the studies was difficult. Furthermore; only a 
      small number of studies were based on women from populations where there is a high 
      risk of zinc deficiency. Therefore; the link between maternal zinc status and 
      pregnancy success in these populations cannot be established. Future studies should 
      focus on those vulnerable to zinc deficiency and include dietary zinc intake as a 
      measure of zinc status.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental pollutant exposure may play certain roles in the 
      pathogenesis and progression of diabetes mellitus including gestational diabetes 
      mellitus (GDM). We hypothesize that heavy metal exposure may trigger GDM during 
      pregnancy. The objective of this study was to investigate the possible associations 
      between selected heavy metal exposure and GDM risk. METHODS: This investigation is a 
      retrospective case-control study nested within a cohort of 1359 pregnant women. 
      These participants were recruited in Xiamen Maternity and Child Care Hospital, 
      China, during June to July, 2012. All their newborns' meconium samples were 
      collected. By reviewing the antenatal care records, 166 GDM mothers were screened 
      out from the 1359 participants; 137 of 166 GDM mothers offered their newborns' 
      meconium samples for the metal analysis. Those 137 mothers were set as the case 
      group. Similarly, 294 healthy mothers without any gestational complication were 
      initially screened out from the rest 1193 non-GDM mothers. 190 of the 294 healthy 
      mothers offered their newborns' meconium samples for the metal analysis. Those 190 
      mothers were set as the control group. Arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), 
      cadmium (Cd), and chromium (Cr) levels in these case-control meconium samples were 
      measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The possible association 
      between the metal levels and maternal GDM risk of studied subjects was assessed by 
      binary logistic regression. RESULTS: GDM prevalence of 12.21% was observed in the 
      investigated 1359 participants. The concentrations of As, Hg, Cr and Cd in studied 
      cases were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those of controls. After adjustments 
      for maternal age, pre-pregnant body mass index, gravidity, parity, hepatitis B virus 
      infection, and newborn sex, As, Cd and Cr were found to be positively associated 
      with GDM prevalence in dose-dependent manners. Among them, As was detected in all 
      samples and its levels associated the maternal GDM with the adjusted odds ratios of 
      3.28 [95% CI 1.24, 8.71], 3.35 [95% CI 1.28, 8.75] and 5.25 [95% CI 1.99, 13.86] for 
      the 2(nd), 3(rd) and 4(th) quartiles, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present work 
      implies that exposure to some of the selected metals (noticeably As) may contribute 
      to maternal GDM risk during pregnancy.

TI  - Is serum zinc status related to gestational diabetes mellitus? A meta-analysis.
PG  - e13239

LID - e13239
AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common medical disorder that begins during 
      pregnancy. The present work aimed to investigate the relationship of maternal or 
      foetal circulatory zinc levels with GDM. Related studies were retrieved against the 
      PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Scopus databases till July 2020. The overall effects 
      were expressed as standard mean difference (SMD). Furthermore, the random effects 
      model was used to assess the summarised risk ratios (SRRs) to determine the 
      relationship between zinc and the risk of GDM. A total of 15 articles involving were 
      retrieved for meta-analysis; in the meantime, 4955 subjects including 1549 GDM cases 
      were enrolled for quantitative analysis. Compared with normal control, GDM cases had 
      decreased circulating zinc level on the whole, but the difference was not 
      statistically significant (SMD = -0.40, 95%CI: -0.80 to -0.00, P = 0.05). 
      Interestingly, upon subgroup analysis stratified by serum zinc content but not 
      plasma zinc concentration, there was significant difference in zinc content between 
      GDM cases and normal controls (SMD = -0.56; 95%CI: -1.07 to -0.04, P = 0.03). 
      Meanwhile, subgroup analysis also revealed similar tendency among the Asians and 
      during the 2nd trimester, but not among the Caucasians or during the 1st or 3rd 
      trimester. Data extracted from four studies that compared pregnant women with GDM in 
      the high level of zinc and GDM in the low level of zinc yielded an SRR of 0.929 
      (95%CI: 0.905-0.954). According to existing evidence, the serum zinc content 
      decreases among GDM cases compared with subjects with no abnormality in glucose 
      tolerance, in particular among the Asians and during the second trimester. 
      Nonetheless, more well designed prospective study should be carried out for 
      understanding the dynamic relationship of zinc level with the incidence of GDM.

TI  - Relationship of Circulating Copper Level with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: a 
      Meta-Analysis and Systemic Review.
PG  - 4396-4409

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) represents the 
      frequently occurring medical disorder beginning in the process of pregnancy. No 
      consensus has been reached about the relationship of circulating copper content with 
      the risk of GDM. Therefore, the present work carried out a meta-analysis for 
      summarizing epidemiological research regarding the copper level with the GDM risk. 
      Furthermore, studies using categories of copper concentration as exposure were 
      combined by dose-response meta-analysis. METHODS: Related studies were retrieved 
      against the PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases from inception till August 
      2020. The overall effects were expressed as standard mean difference (SMD). A 
      dose-response meta-analysis was conducted to assess whether the higher copper 
      concentration was associated with higher risks of GDM. Stata 16.0 and Review Manager 
      5.3 were utilized for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of fourteen articles involving 
      were retrieved for meta-analysis; in the meantime, 2670 pregnant subjects including 
      910 GDM cases were enrolled for quantitative analysis. Based on the integrated 
      findings, GDM cases showed increased circulating copper contents relative to those 
      in normal pregnant subjects (SMD = 0.65, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.11; P = 0.005). There was 
      no obvious evidence of publication bias among the studies enrolled. Subgroup 
      analysis showed that such trend was consistent in the third trimester (SMD = 1.21, 
      95% CI 0.35 to 2.08; P = 0.006) but not second trimester. Meanwhile, circulating 
      copper concentration was significantly higher in women with GDM than those without 
      GDM within the Asian population but not within the Caucasian population (Asia: SMD = 
      0.73; 95% CI 0.12 to 1.34, P = 0.02; Europe: SMD = 0.49; 95% CI: - 0.23 to 1.20, P = 
      0.18). Further, serum copper analysis together with subgroup analysis was conducted, 
      and the same result was obtained. For dose-response analysis, the linear 
      associations between circulating copper and risks of GDM were revealed, that higher 
      circulating copper concentration during pregnancy is closely associated with GDM. 
      CONCLUSION: According to existing evidence, the serum copper concentration increased 
      among GDM cases compared with subjects with normality in glucose tolerance pregnant 
      subject, in particular among the Asians and during the third trimester. The finding 
      from dose-response analysis suggested that increased copper level is associated with 
      an increased risk of GDM. Nonetheless, more specially designed prospective articles 
      should be carried out for understanding the dynamic relationship of copper 
      concentration with the GDM risk.

AB  - Assessing heavy metal pollution in river sediments and identifying the key factors 
      contributing to metal pollution are critical components for devising river 
      environmental protection and remediation strategies to protect human and ecological 
      health. This is especially important in urban areas where metals from a wide range 
      of sources contribute to sediment pollution. In this study, the metal enrichment 
      factor (EF) was used to measure the watershed distribution of Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd in 
      sediments in the Wen-Rui Tang urban river system in Wenzhou, Eastern China. The 
      Geographical Detector Method (GDM) was specifically evaluated for its ability to 
      analyze spatial relationships between metal EFs and their anthropogenic and natural 
      control factors, including densities of industry (DI), livestock (DL), service 
      industries (DS), population (DP), and roads (DR), along with agricultural area (AG), 
      sediment total organic carbon (TOC), and soil types (ST). Results showed that the 
      watershed was highly contaminated by all metals with an EF trend of 
      Cd ≫ Zn > Cu > Pb. The spatial distribution of EFs demonstrated high contamination 
      of all metals in the southwestern region of the watershed where industrial 
      activities were concentrated, and higher Cu and Zn concentrations in the 
      northeastern region having a high density of livestock production. GDM results 
      identified DI as the dominant determinant for all metals, while TOC and ST were 
      determined to have a moderate secondary influence for Zn, Pb and Cd. Additionally, 
      GDM revealed several additive and nonlinear interactions between anthropogenic and 
      natural factors influencing metal concentrations. Compared to other correlation, 
      multiple linear regression and geographically weighted regression, GDM demonstrated 
      distinct advantages of being able to assess both categorical and continuous 
      variables and determine both single and multiple factor interactions. These 
      attributes provide a more comprehensive understanding of metal spatial distributions 
      while avoiding multicollinearity issues when identifying significant contributing 
      factors at the watershed scale.

TI  - The Relationship Between Body Iron Status, Iron Intake And Gestational Diabetes: A 
      Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

AB  - Biological and epidemiological evidence have found that gestational diabetes 
      mellitus (GDM) may be correlated with body iron status and dietary iron intake. 
      Therefore, we investigated the relationship between dietary iron intake and body 
      iron status and GDM risk.We conducted a systematic search in Embase, PubMed, Web of 
      Science, and Cochrane Library up to April 2015. Prospective cohort studies or 
      case-control studies which appraised the relationship between body iron status, 
      dietary iron intake, and GDM risk were included. Relative risks (RRs), standard mean 
      difference (SMD), and 95% confidence intervals [CIs] were used to measure the pooled 
      data.A total of 8 prospective cohort studies and 7 case-control studies were in 
      accordance with inclusive criteria, and 14 studies were included in meta-analysis. 
      The overall RR comparing the highest and lowest levels of serum ferritin was 3.22 
      (95% CI: 1.73-6.00) for prospective cohort studies. Serum ferritin of GDM group is 
      markedly higher than that of control (0.88 ng/mL; 95% CI: 0.40-1.35 ng/mL) for 
      case-control studies. The comparison between the highest and the lowest serum 
      ferritin levels and dietary total iron levels revealed pooled RRs of 1.53 (95% CI: 
      1.17-2.00) and 1.01 (95% CI: 1.00-1.01) for prospective cohort studies, 
      respectively. The combined SMD comparing serum transferrin levels of cases and 
      controls was -0.02 μmol/L (95% CI: -0.22 to 0.19 μmol/L) for case-control 
      studies.Increased higher ferritin levels were significantly correlated with higher 
      risk of GDM, and higher heme iron levels may be correlated with higher risk of GDM; 
      however, the present conclusion did not constitute definitive proof that dietary 
      total iron or serum transferrin have relation to GDM.

TI  - Elevated iron status and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus: A systematic review 
      and meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1111/mcn.12400 [doi]
LID - e12400
AB  - The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies was to 
      assess the relationship between elevated iron status, measured as hemoglobin and 
      ferritin levels, and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The present 
      study was recorded in PROSPERO (2013:CRD42013005717). The selected studies were 
      identified through a systematic review of scientific literature published in The 
      Cochrane Library and PubMed/MEDLINE databases from their inception until March 10, 
      2016, in addition to citation tracking and hand-searches. The search strategy of 
      original articles combined several terms for hemoglobin, ferritin, pregnancy, and 
      GDM. OR and 95% CI of the selected studies were used to identify associations 
      between hemoglobin and/or ferritin levels with the risk of GDM. Summary estimates 
      were calculated by combining inverse-variance using fixed-effects model. 2468 
      abstracts were initially found during the search. Of these, 11 with hemoglobin 
      and/or ferritin data were selected for the meta-analyses. We observed that high 
      hemoglobin (OR = 1.52; 95% CI: 1.23-1.88), as well as ferritin (OR = 2.09; 95% CI: 
      1.48-2.96) levels were linked to an increased risk of GDM. Low heterogeneity was 
      observed in hemoglobin (I(2)  = 33.3%, P = 0.151) and ferritin (I(2)  = 0.7%, 
      P = 0.418) meta-analyses, respectively. Publication bias was not appreciated. High 
      hemoglobin or ferritin levels increase the risk of GDM by more than 50% and more 
      than double, respectively, in the first and third trimester. Therefore, determining 
      of hemoglobin or ferritin concentration in early pregnancy might be a useful tool 
      for recognizing pregnant women at risk of GDM.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affecting about 1% of all children is associated, in 
      addition to complex genetic factors, with a variety of prenatal, perinatal and 
      postnatal etiologies. We discuss the known associated prenatal factors affecting the 
      fetus throughout pregnancy; whenever relevant, also summarize some animal data. 
      Among the maternal diseases in pregnancy associated with ASD are pregestational 
      and/or gestational diabetes mellitus (PGDM, GDM), maternal infections (i.e. rubella, 
      cytomegalovirus (CMV)), prolonged fever and maternal inflammation, which cause 
      changes in a variety of inflammatory cytokines. Among the drugs are valproic acid, 
      thalidomide, and possibly misoprostol and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). 
      Associations were described with ethanol, and possibly cocaine, heavy metals heavy 
      smoking and Folic acid deficiency. Heavy exposure to pesticides and air pollution 
      during pregnancy was recently associated with ASD. We need more epidemiologic data 
      to establish many of these associations; if proven, they might be promising avenues 
      for prevention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Exposure to environmental endocrine disruptors (EDCs) may lead to 
      abnormal glucose metabolism and, potentially, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). 
      OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between five endocrine-disrupting heavy 
      metals (EDHMs), i.e., arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and tin 
      (Sn), in maternal hair and the risk of GDM. METHODS: We conducted a nested 
      case-control study including 335 GDM cases and 343 controls without GDM based on a 
      prospective birth cohort established in Beijing, China. Concentrations of EDHMs were 
      analyzed in maternal hair. Log-binomial regression and multiple linear regression 
      were used to estimate the associations between the hair concentrations of single 
      metals and the risk of GDM, while weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression for their 
      mixed effects. RESULTS: The median concentrations of Hg (0.442 vs. 0.403 μg/g) and 
      Sn (0.171 vs. 0.140 μg/g) in the case group were significantly higher than those in 
      the control group. No differences were found between the two groups for the other 
      three metals. After adjusting for confounders, the prevalence ratio (PR; highest vs. 
      lowest tertile) of GDM risk for Hg was 1.27 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
      1.05-1.54), while that for Sn was 1.26 (95% CI: 1.04-1.53). Among women with a body 
      mass index < 24 kg/m(2), the PR (highest vs. lowest tertile) of GDM for Sn was 1.38 
      (95% CI: 1.09-1.75). The effect of exposure to the five EDHMs on the risk of GDM was 
      estimated by WQS regression: Sn and Hg made the largest contributions to the WQS 
      index (40.9% and 40.3%, respectively). CONCLUSION: High maternal levels of EDHMs, 
      particularly Sn and Hg, may promote the development of GDM.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Emerging findings have raised concerns about significant 
      associations between excessive copper (Cu) and abnormal glucose metabolism. 
      Nevertheless, related researches on the relationship of Cu concentration and 
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are limited. The objective of this study was to 
      determine whether plasma Cu concentration is associated with GDM. METHODS: A 
      case-control study of 248 cases of GDM and 248 age-, parity- and gestational 
      age-matched controls was conducted in Wuhan, China between August 2012 and April 
      2015. Fasting blood samples of participants were collected at the time of GDM 
      screening (≥24 weeks of gestation). Plasma Cu concentrations were detected by 
      inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The strength of the association of 
      plasma Cu with GDM odds was evaluated by odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence 
      intervals (CIs) from conditional logistic regression. Partial Spearman or Pearson 
      correlation coefficients were calculated to estimate the interrelationship between 
      plasma Cu and the risk factors of GDM. RESULTS: Plasma Cu concentrations in the GDM 
      group (mean ± SD: 1960.24 ± 391.98 μg/L) were higher than in the control group 
      (mean ± SD: 1842.43 ± 387.09 μg/L) (P = 0.001). After adjustment for possible 
      confounders, the ORs (95% CIs) of GDM across increasing quartiles of plasma Cu 
      levels were 1.00 (referent), 1.79 (0.90-3.55), 2.72 (1.35-5.48) and 2.91 
      (1.48-5.75), respectively; the OR (95% CI) of GDM was 1.33 (1.06-1.67) for each 
      standard deviation increment of plasma Cu. Moreover, Cu concentrations were 
      positively associated with fasting plasma glucose, 1-h post-glucose load and 2-h 
      post-glucose load (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicated a 
      significantly increased odds of GDM in association with higher concentrations of 
      plasma Cu. Prospective cohort studies in other populations are needed to confirm our 
      findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cadmium (Cd) has been associated with type 2 diabetes in general 
      population. However, the role of Cd in the occurrence of Gestational diabetes 
      mellitus (GDM) remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: Our study was aimed at investigating 
      whether Cd exposure during pregnancy was associated with increased risk of GDM. 
      METHODS: Cd concentrations were measured in urine samples from 6837 pregnant women 
      in Wuhan, China, from 2012 to 2014. A "modified Poisson" model with a robust error 
      variance was used to examine the association of GDM with continuous natural 
      logarithm (ln) transformed urinary Cd or quartiles of urinary Cd levels. RESULTS: 
      For about 3-fold increase in Cd concentrations, there were 16% [relative risk (RR) 
      =1.16; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03, 1.33] increase in risk of GDM. Compared 
      with women in the lowest quartile of urinary Cd levels, women in the highest 
      quartile had 1.30 higher risk of GDM [95% CI: 1.05, 1.61; p-trend <0.05]. Further 
      analyses indicated overweight/obese women with higher urinary Cd levels had 
      significantly higher risk of GDM, compared with women in the reference category of 
      lowest quartile of Cd and normal pre-pregnancy body mass index [RR =2.71; 95% CI: 
      1.81, 4.07]. CONCLUSIONS: Our study presented a significantly positive association 
      between urinary Cd levels and risk of GDM, supporting the hypothesis that 
      environmental exposure to Cd may contribute to the development of GDM.

AB  - PURPOSE: We investigated the impacts of plasma levels of magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), 
      calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), selenium (Se), and chromium (Cr) on GDM risk 
      and the potential mediation effect of blood glucose levels on the relationship 
      between trace elements and GDM risk. METHODS: This nested case-control study was 
      based on data from a birth cohort study conducted in Wuhan, China in 2013-2016. A 
      total of 305 GDM cases and 305 individually-matched controls were included in the 
      study. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations 
      between plasma trace element concentrations and GDM risk. A mediation analysis was 
      conducted to explore whether blood glucose levels act as a mediator between trace 
      element levels and GDM risk. RESULTS: An IQR increment in plasma levels of Fe and Cu 
      was associated with a significant increase in GDM risk [OR = 2.04 (95 % CI 1.62, 
      2.57) and OR = 1.52 (95 % CI 1.25, 1.82)], respectively. On the other hand, an IQR 
      increment in plasma levels of Zn and Ca was associated with a significant decrease 
      in GDM risk [OR = 0.55 (95 % CI 0.43, 0.71) and OR = 0.72 (95 % CI 0.56, 0.92)], 
      respectively. The mediation analysis showed significant mediation of the association 
      between Cu and GDM risk via the FBG (%mediated: 19.27 %), 1 h-PBG (12.64 %), 2h-PBG 
      (28.44 %) pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma levels of Zn and Ca were negatively 
      associated with GDM risk, while Fe and Cu were positively associated. Blood glucose 
      levels act as a mediator between plasma trace element exposures and GDM risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported that cadmium (Cd) is associated with type 
      2 diabetes. However, little is known about Cd exposure and the risk of gestational 
      diabetes mellitus (GDM). OBJECTIVE: We examined the association between Cd body 
      burden in early pregnancy and the risk of GDM. METHODS: We conducted a prospective 
      study of 2,026 pregnant women from a single tertiary medical center between 2013 and 
      2016 in Wuhan, China. Cd body burden was reflected by Cd concentrations in urine 
      samples collected between gestational weeks 8 and 14. GDM was diagnosed according to 
      International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups Consensus Panel 
      (IADPSG) recommendations. RESULTS: The geometric mean of Cd concentrations in 
      maternal urine of all pregnant women was 0.59μg/L. A total of 198 (9.8%) women were 
      diagnosed with GDM. After adjustment for potential confounders, the risk ratios 
      (RRs) of GDM were 1.04 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.44) for the middle tertile of Cd levels and 
      1.36 (95%: CI: 0.98, 1.90) for the top tertile compared with the bottom tertile. In 
      addition, we found a significant interaction between fetal sex and maternal Cd 
      levels on the risk of GDM (p for interaction=0.03). Among women carrying male 
      fetuses, the RR of GDM was 1.86 (95% CI: 1.14, 2.93) for the top tertile of Cd 
      levels compared with the bottom tertile. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the 
      first report of an association between urinary Cd levels in early pregnancy and GDM. 
      Our findings suggest that Cd body burden increases the risk of GDM and that the 
      association may be modified by fetal sex. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2716.

AB  - Evidence is cumulating on the adverse health effects of environmental exposures on 
      health of the fetus and the childbearing mothers. Among mother's conditions, 
      gestational diabetes mellitus has been considered rarely in spite of its importance 
      for both mother and child. We determined the role of maternal exposure to lead (Pb), 
      cadmium (Cd) and manganese (Mn) to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on diagnosed 
      GDM and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) in diabetes-free mothers from the French 
      EDEN mother-child cohort. 623 pregnant women without pre-existing diabetes were 
      included in the study. GDM and IGT were diagnosed by a gynecologist during 
      consultations after blood analysis. Pb, Cd and Mn were measured in second-trimester 
      blood samples. Associations between ln-transformed concentrations of metals and GDM 
      and IGT respectively were examined using multiple logistic regression analysis 
      adjusted for potential confounders. The prevalences of GDM and IGT were 7.1% and 
      10.1% respectively. After adjustment for confounders, Cd was statistically related 
      to having had a diagnosis of GDM or IGT (Adjusted Odds-Ratio (AOR): 1.61, 
      1.05-2.48), and Pb to GDM at borderline significance (AOR: 1.65, 0.82-3.34). Our 
      findings add to the growing evidence supporting the role of maternal exposure to 
      heavy toxic metals that persist longtime in the environment as a risk factor for 
      GDM.

AB  - Groundwater was a desired alternative for decentralized water supply. However, the 
      presence of iron, manganese and ammonia significantly limited its extensive 
      adoptions. In this study, an innovative gravity-driven membrane (GDM) process has 
      been developed to address such problems. The results indicated that GDM process can 
      efficiently diminish the concentrations of iron, manganese and ammonia, with average 
      removal efficiencies of 97%, 95% and 70%, respectively, since the bio-cake layer on 
      the membrane surface can serve as a dynamic barrier for the foulants rejection. In 
      GDM filtration, the manganese removal was mainly attributed to the synergistic 
      effects between the chemically auto-catalytic oxidation by manganese oxides (MnOx) 
      and biological activity by manganese-oxidizing bacteria (MnOB). Pre-addition of MnOx 
      particles into GDM system could significantly enhance the manganese removal and 
      shorten its ripening time by approximately 50%. During long-term filtration, the 
      fluxes of GDM remained stabilized (4-5 L m(-2) h(-1)), and MnOx particles 
      pre-additions could improve the stable fluxes by 23%-37%. The flux stabilization of 
      GDM process was mainly determined by the heterogeneous structures of bio-cake layer, 
      and the generated iron and manganese oxides would improve its heterogeneities. 
      Furthermore, MnOx assisted GDM process conferred robust capacities in resisting the 
      shock loading of manganese and ammonia in the feed water, and the highest 
      concentrations of manganese and ammonia were suggested to be less than 2.96 mg/L and 
      0.9 mg/L, respectively. Therefore, these findings are full of relevance to develop 
      new strategies to treat the iron- and manganese-containing groundwater and promote 
      the extensive application of UF technology for decentralized water supply.

AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common pregnancy complication in high risk 
      populations, and is associated with increased perinatal and long term outcomes for 
      both mothers and newborns. Both its prevention and early management can be 
      reinforced by identifying risks factors, particularly those factors influencing 
      glucose metabolism. On the other hand, several epidemiological studies have shown an 
      increased oxidative stress (OS) in pregnant women with GDM. Elevated OS was also 
      reported in pregnant women supplemented with iron, which can generate OS and may 
      also influence insulin resistance. This review summarizes the current state of 
      knowledge, highlighting the potential relationship between OS induced by iron status 
      and the development of GDM.

TI  - Association between maternal plasma ferritin concentration, iron supplement use, and 
      the risk of gestational diabetes: a prospective cohort study.
PG  - 1100-1106
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/nqab162 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between iron supplementation and gestational diabetes 
      mellitus (GDM) is still inconclusive, and this association has not been extensively 
      studied in relation to plasma ferritin in the early second trimester. OBJECTIVES: We 
      aimed to prospectively examine the independent and combined associations of plasma 
      ferritin concentrations and iron supplement use with GDM. METHODS: We studied 2117 
      women from the Tongji Maternal and Child Health Cohort in Wuhan, China. Plasma 
      ferritin around 16 weeks' gestation was measured by ELISA kits and information on 
      iron supplement use was collected by questionnaires. GDM was diagnosed by a 75-g 
      oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks' gestation. A log-Poisson 
      regression model was used to estimate the RR of GDM associated with plasma ferritin 
      and iron supplementation. RESULTS: The median and IQR of plasma ferritin was 52.1 
      (29.6-89.9) ng/mL, and 863 (40.8%) participants reported use of iron supplements 
      during the second trimester. A total of 219 (10.3%) participants developed GDM. 
      Adjusted RRs (95% CIs) for GDM across increasing quartiles of plasma ferritin were 
      1.00 (reference), 2.14 (1.37, 3.34), 2.03 (1.30, 3.19), and 2.72 (1.76, 4.21), 
      respectively. After adjustment, supplemental iron ≥60 mg/d during the second 
      trimester was associated with an increased risk of GDM compared with nonusers (RR: 
      1.37; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.84). CONCLUSIONS: Both elevated plasma ferritin concentrations 
      in the early second trimester and use of ≥60 mg/d of supplemental iron during 
      pregnancy are independently associated with increased risk of GDM. Further clinical 
      trials with precision nutrition approaches considering both baseline iron status and 
      supplement use are needed to evaluate the benefits and risks of iron supplementation 
      during pregnancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency is the most abundant nutritional deficiency in the world 
      and is discussed to be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. The objective of 
      this review was to perform an umbrella summary of meta-analyses to evaluate the 
      effects and associations of iron supplementation or iron status on maternal and 
      birth/neonatal outcomes. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on PubMed and 
      Scopus by two reviewers without temporal restriction. Systematic reviews and 
      meta-analyses of studies evaluating (1) the effects of multimicronutrient compared 
      to iron + folic acid supplementations on maternal and birth/neonatal outcomes (2), 
      the association of dietary iron intake or hemoglobin or ferritin status regarding 
      the risk for maternal (gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)) and birth/neonatal 
      outcomes, and (3) the effects of iron supplementation on pregnancy and 
      birth/neonatal outcomes, were included in this review. RESULTS: Overall, 16 
      meta-analyses were included. Multimicronutrient supplements had significant risk 
      reducing effects on low birth weight and small for gestational age compared to 
      iron/folic acid supplements as controls. Furthermore, most of the meta-analyses 
      showed that higher levels of hemoglobin or ferritin increased the risk for GDM. On 
      the other hand, maternal anemia (low hemoglobin levels) was associated with adverse 
      birth/neonatal outcomes. Finally, iron supplementation reduced the risk of iron 
      deficiency and iron deficiency anemia and had some risk reducing effects on low 
      birth weight newborns. CONCLUSIONS: Our summary of meta-analyses showed that 
      multimicronutrient supplementation had beneficial effects on some neonatal outcomes. 
      Furthermore, higher ferritin levels seem to increase the risk for GDM whereas 
      maternal anemia was associated with adverse birth/neonatal outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The adverse effects of TI exposure on pregnant women are still unclear, 
      especially regarding the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) Objective: We 
      explored the association between maternal urinary Tl burden and the risk of GDM. 
      METHODS: A subsample of 1789 pregnant women were enrolled who provided spot urine 
      samples before the diagnostic 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Urinary Tl 
      concentration was measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. 
      Logistic regression and covariance analysis were carried out to estimate the 
      association between Tl exposure and GDM risk. RESULTS: The median of urinary Tl 
      concentration was 0.382 μg/L or 0.525 μg/g creatinine (CC-Tl). There were 437 
      (24.4%) participants who were diagnosed with GDM, and the urinary CC-Tl 
      concentrations of pregnant women with GDM were higher than that of pregnant women 
      without GDM [0.548 (0.402, 0.788) vs 0.518 (0.356, 0.724), p = 0.014]. After 
      adjusting for the relevant covariates, an association between urinary Tl 
      concentrations and GDM was found. In comparison to the pregnant women in the lowest 
      quartile of urinary CC-Tl concentration, the pregnant women in the highest quartile 
      had a higher risk of GDM [OR (95% CI) = 1.44 (1.03, 2.02), p-trend = 0.055]. If 
      limited to the pregnant women without family history of diabetes, the results were 
      still robust [OR (95% CI) = 1.59 (1.11, 2.30), p-trend = 0.012]. CONCLUSION: Urinary 
      CC-Tl concentration was associated with GDM among Chinese pregnant women. Our 
      findings provide evidence that moderately high Tl exposure may be a novel risk 
      factor for pregnant women health.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of first trimester maternal 
      serum afamin levels together with vitamin E and various elements (zinc, copper, 
      selenium, and magnesium) for the prediction of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). 
      All pregnant women between 11th and 14th weeks of gestation admitted for combined 
      test were asked to participate in the study. A total of 797 women gave permission to 
      participate in the study between January and September 2019. Serum was obtained by 
      centrifugation and samples were frozen and kept at - 80 °C. For final analysis, 
      forty-three GDM patients and forty-four healthy controls were selected. Levels of 
      afamin, vitamin E, zinc, copper, selenium, and magnesium were compared between 
      groups. The mean levels of afamin were found to be higher in women with GDM without 
      statistical significance (63.69 ± 82.33 vs 44.25 ± 32.25 mg/L, p = 0.149). Vitamin E 
      levels were found to be higher in women with GDM compared to controls without any 
      statistical significance (5.04 ± 5.33 vs 4.47 ± 3.83 μg/mL, p = 0.568). While first 
      trimester copper concentrations were higher among diabetic women (187.26 ± 34.78 vs 
      175.17 ± 30.40 μg/L, p = 0.088), this was not statistically significant. The other 
      element levels (zinc, selenium, and magnesium) were found to be similar between the 
      two groups (p = 0.624, p = 0.088, p = 0.254, p = 0.872, respectively). The results 
      of our study demonstrated that mean levels of afamin, vitamin E, and copper were 
      higher in women with GDM compared to controls. Additionally, first trimester 
      maternal zinc, selenium, and magnesium levels were similar between diabetic and 
      healthy pregnant women. However, more studies are needed to clarify the relationship 
      between blood trace concentrations and GDM.

AB  - Identification and quantification of the distribution, ecological risk, and sources 
      of heavy metals in soils are essential for regional pollution control and 
      management. In this study, spatial analysis (SA), GeogDetector model (GDM), and 
      positive matrix factorization (PMF) model were combined to evaluate the status, 
      ecological risk, and sources of heavy metals in soils from a typical coastal 
      economic development area in Southeastern China. The mean contents of Cd, Pb, Cr, 
      Cu, and Zn in the surface soils (0-20 cm) were 0.45, 41.72, 90.50, 47.86, and 
      145.33 mg/kg, respectively. In accordance, the mean contents of Cd exceeded the risk 
      screening value for contamination of agricultural soil in China. Our results 
      revealed that industrial and residential soils had higher enrichment of heavy metals 
      than agricultural and fallow soils. Industrial production was the major driving 
      factors influencing the spatial distribution of heavy metals. Soil OM and pH were 
      found to be the most important factors affecting the potential ecological risk of 
      heavy metals, followed by distance from the industrial enterprises and roads. Heavy 
      metals in the study area were mainly originated from industrial 
      emissions/atmospheric deposition, agricultural sources, and followed by natural 
      sources. Therefore, regular monitoring and source control for heavy metals, 
      especially for Cd, along with the integrated soil environmental management in the 
      study area are crucial to ensure soil health and ecosystem security.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affecting about 1% of all children is associated, in 
      addition to complex genetic factors, with a variety of prenatal, perinatal, and 
      postnatal etiologies. In addition, ASD is often an important clinical presentation 
      of some well-known genetic syndromes in human. We discuss these syndromes as well as 
      the role of the more important prenatal factors affecting the fetus throughout 
      pregnancy which may also be associated with ASD. Among the genetic disorders we find 
      Fragile X, Rett syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, Timothy syndrome, Phelan-McDermid 
      syndrome, Hamartoma tumor syndrome, Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, and a few 
      others. Among the maternal diseases in pregnancy associated with ASD are diabetes 
      mellitus (PGDM and/or GDM), some maternal autoimmune diseases like antiphospholipid 
      syndrome (APLS) with anti-β2GP1 IgG antibodies and thyroid disease with anti-thyroid 
      peroxidase (TPO) antibodies, preeclampsia and some other autoimmune diseases with 
      IgG antibodies that might affect fetal brain development. Other related factors are 
      maternal infections (rubella and CMV with fetal brain injuries, and possibly 
      Influenza with fever), prolonged fever and maternal inflammation, especially with 
      changes in a variety of inflammatory cytokines and antibodies that cross the 
      placenta and affect the fetal brain. Among the drugs are valproic acid, thalidomide, 
      misoprostol, and possibly SSRIs. β2-adrenergic receptor agonists and paracetamol 
      have also lately been associated with increased rate of ASD but the data is too 
      preliminary and inconclusive. Associations were also described with ethanol, 
      cocaine, and possibly heavy metals, heavy smoking, and folic acid deficiency. Recent 
      studies show that heavy exposure to pesticides and air pollution, especially 
      particulate matter < 2.5 and 10 μm in diameter (PM2.5 and PM10) during pregnancy is 
      also associated with ASD. Finally, we have to remember that many of the associations 
      mentioned in this review are only partially proven, and not all are "clean" of 
      different confounding factors. The associations described in this review emphasize 
      again how little we know about the etiology and pathogenesis of ASD. It is obvious 
      that we need more epidemiologic data to establish many of these associations, but if 
      proven, they might be promising avenues for prevention.

TI  - Gestational diabetes mellitus is associated with increased CD163 expression and iron 
      storage in the placenta.
PG  - e13020
LID - 10.1111/aji.13020 [doi]
AB  - PROBLEM: GDM has been associated with disturbances in iron homeostasis and 
      exaggerated immune activation. We sought to investigate the extent to which 
      placental iron storage and macrophage accumulations were altered in GDM. METHOD OF 
      STUDY: We conducted a retrospective, case-control study of archived placental 
      tissues obtained from 22 pregnancies complicated by GDM and 22 unaffected controls. 
      Controls were matched to cases based on maternal age, gestational age at birth, and 
      method of delivery. Placental tissues were assessed for altered histology and CD68 
      and CD163 staining. Tissue iron was assessed using Prussian blue staining. RESULTS: 
      Maternal hematocrit levels were higher in GDM participants compared to controls 
      (P = 0.02). The presence of meconium-laden macrophages was significantly greater 
      within the amnion of GDM cases (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 12.51). Although the total 
      abundance of CD68-expressing macrophages was not significantly different between 
      groups, we detected a significantly greater abundance of CD163 expression within the 
      chorion and decidua of cases. The total area staining positive for iron was 24% (95% 
      confidence intervals of 2%-46%) greater in GDM placentae versus controls. 
      CONCLUSION: GDM is associated with altered placental histology and increases in 
      meconium-laden macrophages. Greater iron stores within the placentae of women with 
      GDM is consistent with reports that iron excess is associated with an increased risk 
      for GDM. The higher level of expression of CD163 on macrophage-like cells of the 
      chorion and decidua in GDM suggests an increase in M2-like macrophages. Overall, our 
      results add to growing evidence that GDM has direct effects on placental structure.

AB  - A balanced communication between the mother, placenta and foetus is crucial to reach 
      a successful pregnancy. Several windows of exposure to environmental toxins are 
      present during pregnancy. When the women metabolic status is affected by a disease 
      or environmental toxin, the foetus is impacted and may result in altered development 
      and growth. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a disease of pregnancy 
      characterised by abnormal glucose metabolism affecting the mother and foetus. This 
      disease of pregnancy associates with postnatal consequences for the child and the 
      mother. The whole endogenous and exogenous environmental factors is defined as the 
      exposome. Endogenous insults conform to the endo-exposome, and disruptors contained 
      in the immediate environment are the ecto-exposome. Some components of the 
      endo-exposome, such as Selenium, vitamins D and B(12), adenosine, and a high-fat 
      diet, and ecto-exposome, such as the heavy metals Arsenic, Mercury, Lead and Copper, 
      and per- and polyfluoroakyl substances, result in adverse pregnancies, including an 
      elevated risk of GDM or gestational diabesity. The impact of the exposome on the 
      human placenta's vascular physiology and function in GDM and gestational diabesity 
      is reviewed.

AB  - AIMS: Iron supplementation has been recommended for healthy pregnancy, but concerns 
      have been raised regarding the potential adverse effects. We sought to examine the 
      impact of periconceptional iron supplement use on subsequent gestational diabetes 
      mellitus (GDM) risk. METHODS: Participants (N = 5101) with information on 
      periconceptional micronutrient supplementation and diagnosis of GDM were involved. 
      Information on iron supplementation and general characteristics were collected at 
      enrollment and follow-up visits. GDM was diagnosed by oral glucose tolerance tests 
      (OGTT) conducted at 24-28 weeks of gestation. Robust Poisson regression model was 
      used to estimate the relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the 
      effect of iron supplement use on GDM. RESULTS: 10.5% of the participants were 
      diagnosed with GDM and the incidence was significantly higher in users with iron 
      >30 mg/d for more than 3 months (Iron >30-L) than in nonusers. Adjusted RRs (95% CI) 
      were 1.53 (1.21, 1.93) in Iron >30-L group, 1.14 (0.80, 1.61) in users with iron 
      >30 mg/d for<3 months (Iron > 30-S) and 1.15 (0.86, 1.54) in users with iron 
      ≤30 mg/d for any duration (Iron ≤30) respectively, compared to nonusers. This link 
      in Iron >30-L group was even stronger (adjusted RR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.25, 2.31) when 
      restricting the analysis among primiparous and iron-replete participants without 
      family history of diabetes. There were no significant differences in birth outcomes 
      among groups. CONCLUSIONS: Periconceptional iron supplementation >30 mg/d for 
      long-term was associated with increased GDM risk. The need and safety of 
      prophylactic iron supplement in iron-replete pregnant women should be reconsidered.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with increased 
      availability of glucose and macronutrients in fetal circulation and macrosomia. 
      Therefore, the role of GDM in the association between metabolism-disrupting 
      chemicals and birth size deserves attention. OBJECTIVE: We examined whether GDM may 
      mediate or modify the associations between maternal environmental pollutant 
      exposures and offspring birth size measures. METHODS: We analyzed 604 Faroese 
      pregnant women and their offsprings born in 1997-2000. Maternal pregnancy serum 
      concentrations of organochlorine compounds (OCs: polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) 
      congeners and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE)), and five perfluoroalkyl 
      substances (PFASs), and hair and cord blood mercury concentrations were measured. We 
      used regression (single-pollutants) and structural equation models (SEMs) 
      (multiple-pollutant analyses using latent constructs of OCs, PFASs and mercury) to 
      estimate the associations with GDM and birth size measures, accounting for mediation 
      and/or effect modification by GDM. RESULTS: Serum-DDE and hair-mercury 
      concentrations were associated with GDM (adjusted OR per concentration doubling: 
      1.29; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.77 for DDE, and 0.79; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.99 for mercury), but in 
      multiple pollutant-adjusted SEMs only a positive association between OC exposure and 
      GDM remained significant (change in GDM odds per OC doubling: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.05, 
      0.86). PCB and overall OC exposure were positively associated with head 
      circumference (SEM; mean change per OC doubling: 0.13cm; 95% CI, 0.01. 0.25). 
      Overall PFAS exposure was inversely associated with birth weight (SEM; mean change 
      per PFAS doubling: -169g; 95% CI: -359, 21), and for many single-PFASs we found a 
      pattern of inverse associations with birth weight and head circumference in boys, 
      and positive or null associations in girls. None of the environmental pollutants was 
      associated with offspring length. GDM neither modified nor mediated the associations 
      with birth size measures. CONCLUSIONS: We found associations with GDM and offspring 
      birth size to be specific to the environmental pollutant or pollutant group. 
      Associations with birth size measures appear to be independent of GDM occurrence.

TI  - Estimation of Serum Zinc, Copper and Magnesium Levels in Bangladeshi women with 
      Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Attending in a Tertiary Care Hospital.
PG  - 157-162
AB  - Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu) and Magnesium (Mg) are essential trace elements for normal 
      embryogenesis and fetal growth. Alteration of Zn, Cu and Mg concentrations in blood 
      has been observed in normal pregnancy as well as in gestational diabetes mellitus 
      (GDM). Aim of this study was to evaluate the serum Zn, Cu and Mg levels in 
      Bangladeshi women with GDM in their second and third trimester of pregnancy. This 
      descriptive cross sectional study was conducted at Mymensingh Medical College 
      Hospital (MMCH), Mymensingh, Bangladesh from July 2013 to June 2014. Pregnant women, 
      in their second and third trimester, attending the outpatient department of 
      Obstetrics and Gynecology and the Department of Endocrinology of MMCH were enrolled 
      by purposive sampling technique. GDM was diagnosed on the basis of oral glucose 
      tolerance test (OGTT) as defined in WHO criteria 2013. Out of 172 participants, 86 
      had GDM (Case) and 86 were normoglycemic (control). The mean age of GDM and control 
      groups was 28.6±3.2 years and 27.3±3.1 years respectively. The BMI was 26.4±1.5kg/m² 
      and 26.3±1.3kg/m². In this study we found serum Zn levels in GDM cases were 
      significantly (p<0.001) low in both trimesters (43.93±5.48μg/dl and 46.86±3.12μg/dl) 
      compared to those without GDM (67.30±7.81μg/dl and 67.58±9.12μg/dl). On the 
      contrary, serum Cu levels in GDM cases were significantly (p<0.001) higher in both 
      trimesters (224±3.8μg/dl and 243.91±6.9μg/dl) compared to those without GDM 
      (220.1±7.6μg/dl and 234.9±4.6μg/dl). There was significant (p<0.001) increase of 
      serum Cu levels in 3rd trimester compared to 2nd trimester in both GDM and non GDM 
      cases. Serum Mg level was significantly low (p<0.001) in 2nd and 3rd trimesters in 
      GDM cases (1.39±0.26mg/dl and 0.93±0.15mg/dl) compared to control group 
      (1.67±0.30mg/dl and 1.67±0.31mg/dl). There was distinct alteration of serum Zn, Cu 
      and Mg levels in GDM compared to normal pregnancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A small number of epidemiological studies have suggested the association 
      of antimony (Sb) exposure with type 2 diabetes risk. However, little is known about 
      the relationship between Sb exposure during pregnancy and risk of gestational 
      diabetes mellitus (GDM). OBJECTIVES: To investigate the associations of urinary Sb 
      concentrations with GDM risk and blood glucose levels in pregnant women. METHODS: We 
      analyzed the baseline data of 1789 pregnant women enrolled in the Birth Cohort Study 
      on Prenatal Environments and Offspring Health (PEOH) in Guangzhou, China. Sb 
      concentrations in urine were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass 
      spectrometry (ICP-MS). Logistic regression and analysis of covariance were used to 
      evaluate associations of Sb exposure with GDM risk and blood glucose levels. 
      RESULTS: A total of 437 (24.4%) women were diagnosed with GDM. The relative risk of 
      GDM for women in the highest quartile of creatinine-corrected Sb (CC-Sb) 
      concentrations was 1.55 [RR (95% CI) = 1.55 (1.12, 2.15), p-trend = 0.005], compared 
      with women in the lowest quartile. Moreover, the women in the top quartile of CC-Sb 
      levels had a 5.2% higher 1 h blood glucose and a 4.2% higher 2 h blood glucose than 
      those in the bottom quartile. We also found an interactive effect between maternal 
      age and CC-Sb on the risk of GDM (p-interaction < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study 
      suggested significant positive associations of Sb exposure with increased GDM risk 
      and impaired blood glucose homeostasis in pregnant women, and the Sb-GDM association 
      might be modified by maternal age.

PG  - 676-685
LID - 10.1039/c8mt00331a [doi]
AB  - 76 pregnant women, among them 38 affected by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and 
      38 control subjects, were recruited at the University Hospital of Padua (Italy). 
      Placenta samples, maternal whole blood and umbilical cord whole blood were collected 
      after delivery and analysed via ICP-MS to determine the metallome, i.e. the whole 
      elemental content. Results were statistically evaluated to evidence the correlation 
      between the elemental concentrations in all samples and the presence of the disease. 
      The results obtained in whole cord blood showed that many elements were correlated 
      with GDM: Ca, Cu, Na, and Zn were present in higher concentration in GDM cord blood 
      than in control samples, whereas Fe, K, Mn, P, Rb, S and Si showed an opposite 
      trend. It was also highlighted that the cord blood from GDM patients exhibited an 
      elemental composition more similar to that of the mother blood compared with the 
      cord blood from control subjects. These results, in part interpreted in the light of 
      the literature, open the possibility to use cord blood as a GDM marker, thus helping 
      to delineate more accurate nutritional guidelines for pregnant women and to explain 
      the biochemical processes occurring in the fetus and placenta during GDM.

TI  - The metallome of the human placenta in gestational diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 1146-54
LID - 10.1039/c5mt00050e [doi]
AB  - Obtaining the knowledge of the "omics" and therefore of the metallomics of 
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) appears to be a necessary task to obtain 
      information about the molecular causes of this disease. In this study, the metallome 
      of GDM and of other types of diabetes mellitus was first reviewed. The comparative 
      analysis of the published data revealed that no GDM elemental markers could be 
      identified with sufficient reliability in blood or in the other considered samples, 
      with the partial exception of selenium. The placenta was chosen as an alternative 
      target organ for the analysis of the GDM metallome. The full elemental average 
      composition of 19 healthy placentas was obtained by ICP-MS. Analyses were then 
      performed on 28 placentas from women affected by GDM. The statistical tests and the 
      principal component analysis evidenced that cadmium was found in lower 
      concentrations and selenium was found in higher concentrations in GDM placentas than 
      in those of the control group. These results were interpreted in light of literature 
      data, and they attract attention on two key elements for understanding the molecular 
      pathways of GDM.

TI  - Zinc Levels and Birth Weight in Pregnant Women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A 
      Matched Cohort Study in China.
LID - dgaa171 [pii]
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgaa171 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zinc (Zn) has been suggested to impact fetal growth. However, the effect 
      may be complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) due to its impact on fetal 
      growth and placental transport. This study aims to investigate whether GDM modifies 
      the association between Zn levels and birth weight. METHOD: A cohort matched by GDM 
      was established in Taiyuan, China, between 2012 and 2016, including 752 women with 
      GDM and 744 women without. Dietary Zn intake was assessed during pregnancy. Maternal 
      blood (MB) and cord blood (CB) Zn levels were measured at birth. Birth weight was 
      standardized as the z score and categorized as high (HBW, >4000 g) and low (LBW, 
      <2500 g) groups. Multivariate linear regression and multinomial logistic regression 
      were used to examine the association between Zn levels and birth weight in offspring 
      born to women with or without GDM. RESULTS: 88.8% (N = 1328) of the population had 
      inadequate Zn intake during pregnancy. In women with GDM, MB Zn level was inversely 
      associated with birth weight (β = -.17; 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.34 to 
      -0.01), while CB Zn level was positively associated with birth weight (β = .38; 95% 
      CI, 0.06-0.70); suggestive associations were observed between MB Zn level and LBW 
      (odds ratio 2.01; 95% CI, 0.95-4.24) and between CB Zn level and HBW (odds ratio 
      2.37; 95% CI, 1.08-5.21). CONCLUSIONS: GDM may modify the associations between MB 
      and CB Zn levels and birth weight in this population characterized by insufficient 
      Zn intake. These findings suggest a previously unidentified path of adverse effects 
      of GDM.

TI  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in the Republic of Kosovo: a retrospective pilot 
      study.
PG  - 88-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: GDM is a condition in which women without previously diagnosed diabetes 
      exhibit high blood glucose levels during pregnancy. Pregnancy causes some insulin 
      resistance in all women, but only a few develop GDM. OBJECTIVE: To test the 
      hypothesis that women with GDM have impaired regulation of blood iron storage and 
      transport, decreased renal function due to decreased glomerular filtration rate and 
      occurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Incidence of 
      blood iron storage was investigated in n=30 pregnant kosovar women with GDM after 
      mild of pregnancy and in n=30 pregnant women without GDM (years 2010-2012). RESULTS 
      AND DISCUSSION: Baby weights, both systolic and diastolic BP, creatinine, albumin, 
      lymphocytes, monocytes, WBC and granulocytes in both groups were within their normal 
      ranges in both groups. Compared to control group, glucose was higher in women with 
      GDM (mean +/- SD: 7.43 +/- 2.23 mg/dL vs. 4.33 +/- 0.63 mg/dL; P < 0.001). Women 
      with GDM had also higher RBC (mean +/- SD: 4.4 +/- 0.8% vs. 3.8 +/- 0.3%; P < 0.005) 
      and HGB (mean +/- SD: 13.0 +/- 3.2 g/dL vs. 11.2 +/- 1.4 mg/dL; P < 0.05), and 
      decreased renal functionality (MDRD-GFR: 92.8 +/- 25.8 g/dL vs. 108.2 +/- 38.2 g/dL; 
      P < .05). CONCLUSION: There is a potential association between iron status and GDM. 
      The role of iron from diet and/or from supplementation in GDM pathogenesis needs 
      still to be examined. In addition we have observed a decrease of glomerular 
      filtration rate in women with GDM. Due to the lack of studies on the relationships 
      between GDM and UTI, and to the retrospective design of the present investigation, 
      it is difficult to establish whether UTI may be a GDM causal factor or a consequence 
      of GDM symptoms, signs and/or of its correlated pathologies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have observed that cadmium (Cd) exposure of pregnant 
      women was associated with increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). 
      However, the potential mechanism still remains unclear. In addition, various animal 
      studies have suggested that Cd exposure could affect fatty acids (FAs) metabolism, 
      but data on humans are scant. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a nested case-control study 
      to investigate the associations of urinary Cd concentrations with levels of 
      circulating FAs and risk of GDM in pregnant women, and further to examine the role 
      of FAs in mediating the relationship between Cd exposure and risk of GDM. METHODS: A 
      total of 305 GDM cases were matched to 305 controls on pregnant women's age (±2 
      years) and infant's gender from a birth cohort study conducted in Wuhan, China. 
      Urinary Cd concentrations and levels of plasma FAs between 10 and 16 gestational 
      weeks were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and gas 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. Conditional logistic regressions 
      models were used to estimate the associations of Cd concentrations and levels of FAs 
      with the risk of GDM. Multiple linear regression models were applied to estimate the 
      associations between Cd concentrations and levels of FAs. Mediation analysis was 
      used to assess the mediating role of FAs in the association of Cd with the risk of 
      GDM. RESULTS: Urinary concentrations of Cd in cases (median: 0.69 μg/L) were 
      significantly higher than controls (median: 0.59 μg/L, P < 0.05). Cd concentrations 
      were positively associated with the risk of GDM (P(trend) = 0.003). Compared to the 
      first tertile of Cd, the adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of GDM risk 
      were 2.08 (1.29, 3.36) for the second tertile and 2.09 (1.32, 3.33) for the third 
      tertile. Cd concentrations were positively correlated with levels of eicosadienoic 
      acid and arachidonic acid/eicosapentaenoic acid ratio, but negatively correlated 
      with levels of stearic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, total odd-chain saturated fatty 
      acids, total n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and n-3 PUFAs/n-6 PUFAs ratio. 
      We did not observe evidence that the association of Cd exposure and risk of GDM was 
      mediated through FAs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirmed the association of higher 
      Cd exposure with increased risk of GDM in pregnant women, and provided forceful 
      epidemiological evidence for the relation of Cd concentrations and levels of FAs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimony (Sb) has been associated with type 2 diabetes in previous 
      studies. However, the role of Sb in the incidence of Gestational diabetes mellitus 
      (GDM) remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the association between Sb 
      exposure during early pregnancy and the risk of GDM. METHODS: We performed a 
      prospective study of 2093 pregnant women from the Tongji Maternal and Child Health 
      Cohort (TMCHC). Sb concentrations were measured in urine samples during early 
      pregnancy by ICP-MS. The association between urinary Sb concentration and GDM 
      incidence was assessed using robust Poisson regression model after adjustment for 
      confounders. RESULTS: The 95th percentile value of creatinine-corrected Sb (CC-Sb) 
      concentration in the urine of all pregnant women was 1.33 μg/g. The CC-Sb 
      concentrations were significantly higher in women with GDM than those without GDM 
      (median value: 0.49 μg/g vs. 0.38 μg/g, p = 0.001). After adjustment for potential 
      confounders, for each one natural logarithmic unit increase in Sb concentration, 
      there was 29% [adjusted relative risk (RR) = 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI): 
      1.06, 1.57] increase in the risk of GDM. Women in the highest tertile for CC-Sb had 
      a 1.92-fold (95% CI: 1.42, 2.60) higher risk of GDM compared with women in the 
      lowest tertile (p-value for trend <0.001). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the 
      first research of an association between urinary Sb levels during pregnancy and GDM. 
      Our study suggests that pregnant women with higher Sb exposure levels may have a 
      higher risk of GDM and this association remains consistent even after 
      stratification.

AB  - AIM: To analyze the relationship between iron metabolism index and stress hormones, 
      insulin resistance, and oxidative stress in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). 
      METHODS: From January to November 2019, 75 patients with GDM were selected as GDM 
      group, according to age of 1:1; 75 normal pregnant women were selected as Control 
      group. Blood glucose, insulin, stress hormones such as cortisol, norepinephrine 
      (NE), and epinephrine (E), and iron metabolism index such as serum iron, serum 
      ferritin (SF), and transferrin saturation (TS) were measured. Insulin resistance was 
      evaluated by homeostasis model insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR). Multiple linear 
      regression was used to analyze the relationship between iron metabolism index and 
      stress hormones, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. RESULTS: The levels of 
      NE, E, serum iron, SF, and TS saturation in the GDM group were higher than Control 
      group (t = 3.82, 2.75, 3.14, 6.12, and 3.90, P < 0.05, <0.05, <0.05, <0.01, <0.01); 
      HOMA-IR was higher in the GDM group (t = 4.92, P < 0.01); malondialdehyde (MDA) was 
      higher, while superoxide dismutase (SOD) was lower than Control group (t = 5.25, 
      4.98, both P < 0.01). Epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, and serum ferritin were 
      positively correlated (r = 0.21, 0.17, and 0.21); epinephrine, cortisol, and 
      transferrin were positively correlated (r = 0.12, 0.31). There was a positive 
      correlation between HOMA-IR and SF and TS (r = 0.34, 0.34). MDA was positively 
      correlated with SF and TS (r = 0.24, 0.29); SOD was negatively related to SF and TS 
      (r = -0.12, -0.17). CONCLUSIONS: Iron metabolism index is related to insulin 
      resistance in GDM women. The change in iron metabolism may be involved in the 
      pathogenesis of gestational diabetes caused by stress- adaptive disorder.

AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common pregnancy 
      complications and results in adverse outcomes for pregnant women and their 
      offspring. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is associated with insulin resistance 
      and implicates in the development of GDM. Zinc, selenium and chromium have been 
      shown to maintain glucose homeostasis via multiple mechanisms, but how these trace 
      elements affect the insulin resistance and ER stress in GDM are largely unknown. To 
      address this, a GDM rat model was induced by feeding female Sprague-Dawley rats a 
      high-fat (45%) and sucrose diet, while zinc (10 mg/kg.bw), selenium (20 ug/kg.bw), 
      chromium (20 ug/kg.bw) were daily supplemented alone or in combination from 6 weeks 
      before mating to the end of lactation period. Maternal metabolic parameters, hepatic 
      ER stress and insulin signaling were analyzed. The results showed that zinc, 
      selenium and chromium co-supplementation dramatically alleviated high-fat and 
      sucrose-induced glucose intolerance and oxidative stress during entire experiment 
      period. Hepatic ER stress as well as the unfolded protein response was activated in 
      GDM dams, characterized by the up-regulation of glucose-regulated protein 78, 
      phosphorylated the protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, and the 
      inositol-requiring enzyme 1α. Zinc, selenium and chromium supplementation 
      significantly prevented this activation, by which contributes to the promotion of 
      the phosphorylated protein kinase B related insulin signaling and maintenance of 
      glucose homeostasis. In conclusion, zinc, selenium and chromium supplementation may 
      be a promising way to prevent the development of GDM by alleviating hepatic ER 
      stress.

PG  - 91-96
LID - 10.23736/S0391-1977.18.02734-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of serum iron 
      and ferritin concentrations in early pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus 
      (GDM) complicated in pregnant metaphase through detecting the serum iron and 
      ferritin concentrations in early pregnancy of normal pregnant women, so as to 
      provide new ideas for the early detection and prevention of GDM. METHODS: 
      Spontaneously pregnant women with single fetus receiving prenatal routine 
      examination in our hospital from December 2014 to October 2016 were selected. They 
      were in good health before with normal fasting blood-glucose in early pregnancy 
      without anemia during pregnancy and any medication history. The serum iron and 
      ferritin concentrations were measured at 12 gestational weeks, the fasting 
      blood-glucose was detected at 12 weeks of pregnancy, and 75g oral glucose tolerance 
      test was performed at 24-26 weeks. According to the results of oral glucose 
      tolerance test, the pregnant women were divided into GDM group (N.=52) and normal 
      control group (N.=310). The detection results of pregnant women in the two groups 
      were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The serum ferritin and iron levels at 12 
      gestational weeks in GDM group were higher than those in normal pregnancy group 
      (P<0.05). The cut-off values of serum ferritin and iron at 12 gestational weeks in 
      the prediction of GDM were 67.8 μg/L and 52.9 mmol/L. CONCLUSIONS: The high 
      concentrations of serum iron and ferritin in early pregnancy have a certain 
      correlation with the incidence of GDM, and the early detection of serum iron and 
      ferritin levels can improve the detection rate of GDM in pregnant metaphase.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High blood glucose has been noted in case reports of acute thallium 
      poisoning, however, effects of low-level exposure of thallium on risk of gestational 
      diabetes mellitus (GDM) has not been explored yet. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to explore 
      the association of serum thallium concentration (STC) in early pregnancy and risk of 
      GDM. METHODS: Data of 3013 women from the Ma'anshan birth cohort study (MABC), China 
      was used. STC was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). 
      Multivariate logistic regression was performed to the association of STC and risk of 
      GDM. Stratified analysis was carried out according to maternal age and pre-pregnancy 
      BMI. RESULTS: We documented 383 incident GDM (12.7%). The STC ranged from 0.011 to 
      0.232 μg/L with a median of 0.062 μg/L. Women with advanced age and higher 
      pre-pregnancy BMI tended to have higher level of STC. Individuals in GDM-group have 
      higher level of STC than that in non-GDM group (P =  0.007). Maternal STC in early 
      pregnancy was associated with risk of GDM, but the association attenuated to 
      non-significance after adjusted for pre-pregnancy BMI. In the advanced age (>30 
      years) group, STC was significantly associated with risk of GDM in a dose-response 
      manner (P for trend <0.05). Compared with the Quintile 1, the odds ratios (ORs) (95% 
      confidence interval, CI) of Quintile 2, Quintile 3, Quintile 4, and Quintile 5 were 
      1.48 (0.62-3.53), 2.70 (1.21-6.03), 2.85 (1.29-6.31), 2.30 (1.05-5.05) in the most 
      adjusted model (including pre-pregnancy BMI). CONCLUSIONS: Our study was the first 
      study to demonstrate an association of maternal STC in early pregnancy and risk of 
      GDM, and the association was partly mediated by pre-pregnancy BMI. This association 
      exhibited as an age-dependent manner. Our study highlights even very low-level of 
      thallium exposure could already pose a threat to human's health.

TI  - Use of Chitosan and Other Natural Compounds Alone or in Different Strategies with 
      Copper Hydroxide for Control of Grapevine Downy Mildew.
PG  - 3261-3268
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-06-20-1268-RE [doi]
AB  - Grapevine downy mildew (GDM) is one of the most serious diseases of grapevines. 
      Limitations to the use of copper-based products in organic agriculture according to 
      the European Union (EU) regulation EU/2002/473 and the later EU Commission 
      implementing regulation 2018/1981 have promoted a search for alternatives. This 
      5-year field trial evaluated the effectiveness of several strategies against GDM 
      using different chitosan-based formulations and application rates in comparison with 
      other natural compounds applied individually or with copper hydroxide. Trials were 
      performed in commercial vineyards with different environmental conditions and 
      grapevine cultivars. For the natural compounds applied as individual treatments, a 
      0.5%/0.8% chitosan formulation provided the best protection against GDM; the other 
      compounds and formulations were less effective. When copper hydroxide use was halved 
      by combining it with the natural compounds according to three different strategies, 
      the GDM incidence, severity, and McKinney index were reduced, particularly for 
      copper hydroxide applied in combination with the 0.5%/0.8% chitosan formulation. The 
      0.5%/0.8% chitosan formulation alone and with copper hydroxide provided good 
      protection against GDM during both high-pressure and low-pressure disease seasons. 
      Therefore, chitosan represents a good alternative to copper formulations for the 
      control of GDM and both organic and integrated disease management.

TI  - Iron-Related Factors in Early Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Gestational Diabetes 
      Mellitus: the Ma'anshan Birth Cohort (MABC) Study.

AB  - Iron is an essential micronutrient while its excessive load has been related to the 
      etiology of diabetes. We used data of 3289 pregnant women from the Ma'anshan birth 
      cohort (MABC) study in China to examine the associations of three iron-related 
      factors (i.e., serum iron (SI) concentration, hemoglobin level, and use of iron 
      supplements) with risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Emphatically explore 
      the potential non-linear relationship between SI concentration and risk of GDM. SI 
      concentration was measured in fasting blood using inductively coupled plasma mass 
      spectrometry (ICP-MS). GDM diagnosis was determined by 75 g oral glucose tolerance 
      test at 24~28 weeks. Restricted cubic splines with three knots were used to examine 
      potential non-linear relationship between SI concentration and GDM risk. We observed 
      a U-shape relation between SI concentration in the first trimester and risk of GDM. 
      In the multivariate-adjusted model, compared with the middle level (ln(SI), 
      7.1-7.7 μg/L), both the lowest level (ln(SI) ≤ 7.1 μg/L) (odds ratio (OR) = 1.35, 
      95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.76) and the highest level (ln(SI) > 7.7 μg/L) 
      (OR = 1.63, 95%CI = 1.16-2.28) increased risk of GDM. Associations of hemoglobin 
      level in the first trimester and risk of GDM attenuated to non-significance after 
      adjustment for pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure. Pre-pregnancy 
      iron supplement use was associated with an increased risk of GDM (OR = 1.57, 
      95%CI = 1.06-2.32). In conclusion, the three iron-related factors are all related to 
      GDM risk on some level.

AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects between 2 and 14% of pregnant women in 
      the United States every year. Currently, glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) are the 
      standard biomarkers used to monitor GDM but HbA1c is representative of 2-3 months of 
      glycemic data and is too infrequent for managing clinical impact of GDM while 
      glucose provides multiple daily readings which arguably are not entirely necessary 
      for mild to moderate GDM and often result in non-compliance from the patient's side. 
      Thus, there is a need for an intermediate biomarker which can be used effectively to 
      monitor the glycemic status of GDM patients. Serum albumin, the most abundant 
      protein in blood, undergoes non-enzymatic glycation in the bloodstream. Owing to its 
      half-life of ~21 days, it can effectively be used as an intermediate biomarker. 
      Normal level of glycation of albumin is between 10 and 16% whereas in diabetic 
      patients it is much higher, between 16 and 40%. Thus, a point-of-care (POC) 
      monitoring system to detect glycated albumin (GA) as a % of total serum albumin has 
      been developed here. Specifically, a dipstick paper fluidic test to measure % 
      glycated albumin has been developed that used an aptamer assay with gold 
      nanoparticles to produce colorimetric measurements. Both the glycated and unglycated 
      versions of albumin were measured in their relevant physiological concentration 
      ranges - 50 μM-300 μM with a limit of detection (LoD) of 6.5 μM for glycated albumin 
      and 500 μM-750 μM with a LoD of 21 μM for unglycated serum albumin. The use of 
      aptamers as recognition elements, instead of commonly used antibodies, not only 
      provided the required sensitivity, specificity, and dynamic range but they also have 
      the added advantage of being stable at room temperature for an extended period of 
      time providing the potential for these dipstick tests to be used for GDM monitoring 
      at the point-of-care (POC).

PG  - 385-9
AB  - The possible effect of iron supplementation has been investigated in the normal 
      population and patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). In this study, we 
      survey the risk factors of GDM in pregnant women in contrast with normoglycemic 
      patients in a case control study in patients using iron supplement. This case 
      control study conducted on 52 pregnant women with GDM (25 women with type Al and 27 
      women with Type A2 of GDM). The control group randomly selected 50 normoglycemic 
      women. Venous blood sampling was done between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy for 
      measuring of ferritin, lipoproteins, uric acid and malondialdehyde serum levels. 
      Under study variables including age, gestational age, weight and BMI were gathered. 
      All the women were followed up until the time of delivery and pregnancy outcome were 
      gathered. The serum ferritin levels in GDM group was 31.22+15.44, which is 
      significantly higher than 24.76+8.94, in the control group with (P=0.012). Plasma 
      hemogulobin in the control group was 12.2+0.1 compared to 12.9+0.1 in GDM group 
      which was significantly lower (P=0.005). Triglycerides was significantly higher in 
      GDM group in contrast with the control group, 275.08+143.17 and 192.30+92.13 
      (P=0.001), respectively. Finally, our findings indicate the concentration of serum 
      ferritin levels was significantly higher in The GDM group.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental cadmium (Cd) exposure is associated with type 2 diabetes. 
      However, the association of Cd and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is unknown. 
      OBJECTIVES: We examined the association between body burden of Cd and GDM risk. 
      METHODS: We used 140 GDM cases and 481 randomly selected noncase subcohort members 
      from the Omega Study to conduct a case-cohort study. Creatinine (Cr)-corrected Cd in 
      early pregnancy urine (U-Cd) was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass 
      spectrometry. Tertiles (< 0.29; 0.29-0.42; ≥ 0.43 μg/g Cr) were defined using the 
      subcohort's U-Cd distribution. GDM was diagnosed using the 2004 American Diabetes 
      Association guidelines. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals 
      (CIs) were estimated using logistic regression. RESULTS: GDM cases had higher 
      geometric mean U-Cd (0.39 μg/g Cr; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.41) than noncases (0.31 μg/g Cr; 
      95% CI: 0.29, 0.33). Odds ratios for GDM increased with increasing U-Cd tertile (OR 
      = 1.64; 95% CI: 0.88, 3.05 for middle vs. low tertile; OR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.15, 3.73 
      for high vs. low tertile; p-trend = 0.015). Overweight/obesity (body mass index ≥ 25 
      kg/m(2)) did not modify the association between U-Cd and GDM (p = 0.26). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that body burden of Cd increases risk of GDM in a 
      dose-dependent manner. Improved understanding of environmental factors influencing 
      GDM may facilitate early identification of women at high risk of GDM.

TI  - [Investigation of iron deficiency status in the newborns of gestational diabetes 
      mellitus women].
PG  - 25-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the iron status in the newborns of maternal gestational 
      diabetes mellitus (GDM) women, and explore the mechanism of iron deficiency in these 
      newborns. METHODS: From June 2008 to October 2011, 64 GDM women (GDM group) and 71 
      healthy pregnant women (control group) who delivered in the Second Affiliated 
      Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College and their newborns were studied prospectively. 
      Serum ferritin (SF), serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), erythropoietin (Epo), 
      haemoglobin (Hb), serum level of insulin and plasma glucose in cord blood was 
      measured. The neonatal birth weight (BW) and birth weight Z Score (WAZ) was 
      recorded. The concentrations of serum fasting insulin (FINS), fasting plasma glucose 
      (FPG) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were tested for all the women before 
      delivery. RESULTS: In the GDM group, the cord blood sTfR, Epo and serum level of 
      insulin was (42 ± 10) nmol/L, (56 ± 41) U/L and (18 ± 5) U/L, respectively. While in 
      the control group, these were (35 ± 8) nmol/L, (41 ± 43) U/L and (10 ± 5) U/L, 
      respectively. The cord blood sTfR, Epo and serum level of insulin in the GDM group 
      were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The cord blood 
      SF in the GDM group [(60 ± 36) µg/L] was significantly lower than that of the 
      control group [(146 ± 38) µg/L, P < 0.01]. The neonatal BW and WAZ in the GDM group 
      [(3615 ± 538) g and 0.558] were significantly higher than those in the control group 
      [(3449 ± 423) g and 0.224, P < 0.05]. No significant difference was found in the 
      cord blood plasma glucose and Hb between the GDM group [(3.3 ± 1.0) mmol/L and (181 
      ± 18) g/L] and the control group [(3.0 ± 0.8) mmol/L and (176 ± 16) g/L, P > 0.05]. 
      The FINS and HbA1c of the GDM group [(12.5 ± 5.0) U/L and (6.5 ± 0.7)%] were 
      significantly higher than those in the control group [(10.9 ± 4.3) U/L and (5.3 ± 
      0.7)%, P < 0.05]. The FPG of the GDM group and the control group were (5.3 ± 1.2) 
      and (5.0 ± 1.0) mmol/L, respectively, with no statistically significant difference 
      (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Maternal GDM may related to the iron deficiency of the 
      newborns.

TI  - Influence on grape aromatic compounds of natural fungicides used for the control of 
      downy mildew.
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.11814 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The grape volatile fraction determines to a great extent its aroma, 
      which is one of the most important characteristics influencing wine quality and 
      consumer preferences. Grapevine downy mildew (GDM) is one of the most important and 
      devastating diseases of grapevines worldwide. In this study, the impact on the 
      volatile composition of cv. Verdicchio grapes of classical copper formulations, was 
      compared to that of alternative products. Thus, 11 treatments were foliar applied 
      throughout one grapevine cycle. RESULTS: Most of the volatile compounds present in 
      the grapes were not affected by the treatments used in order to prevent GDM. In the 
      case of the total C(13) norisoprenoids, some differences were found between grapes 
      untreated control and those applied with the grapefruit seed extract. Moreover, the 
      content of alcohols was smaller in grapes from Bordeaux mixture treatment and higher 
      in the samples from chitosan application. CONCLUSION: Therefore, from the 
      qualitative point of view of the berry, treatment with tested products alternative 
      to copper is recommended, which minimize the environmental and health problems that 
      this heavy metal brings to the soil and in the winery, since it means that their 
      applications did not affect the grape aroma.

TI  - Middle Iron-Enriched Fructose Diet on Gestational Diabetes Risk and on Oxidative 
      Stress in Offspring Rats.
PG  - 405-413
LID - 10.1007/s12011-016-0791-3 [doi]
AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with increased insulin resistance 
      and a heightened level of oxidative stress (OS). Additionally, high iron consumption 
      could also increase insulin resistance and OS, which could aggravate GDM risk. The 
      aim of this study is to evaluate a high fructose diet (F) as an alternative 
      experimental model of GDM on rats. We also have evaluated the worst effect of a 
      fructose iron-enriched diet (FI) on glucose tolerance and OS status during 
      pregnancy. Anthropometric parameters, plasma glucose levels, insulin, and lipid 
      profile were assessed after delivery in rats fed an F diet. The effects observed in 
      mothers (hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia) and on pups (macrosomia and 
      hypoglycemia) are similar to those observed in women with GDM. Therefore, the 
      fructose diet could be proposed as an experimental model of GDM. In this way, we can 
      compare the effect of an iron-enriched diet on the metabolic and redox status of 
      mother rats and their pups. The mothers' glycemic was similar in the F and FI 
      groups, whereas the glycemic was significantly different in the newborn. In rat pups 
      born to mothers fed on an FI diet, the activities of the antioxidant enzyme 
      glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione-S-transferase in livers and GPx in 
      brains were altered and the gender analysis showed significant differences. Thus, 
      alterations in the glycemic and redox status in newborns suggest that fetuses are 
      more sensitive than their mothers to the effect of an iron-enriched diet in the case 
      of GDM pregnancy. This study proposed a novel experimental model for GDM and 
      provided insights on the effect of a moderate iron intake in adding to the risk of 
      glucose disorder and oxidative damage on newborns.

AB  - This study aims to assess the relationship between oxidative DNA damage and iron 
      status in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) compared to those with 
      normal glucose tolerance in the first and the second trimesters of pregnancy. 
      Maternal serum and urine samples were collected in the 11th-14th weeks and the 
      24th-28th weeks of gestation. In addition to oral glucose tolerance test in the 
      second trimester, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, ferritin and hemoglobin levels were 
      measured in blood samples. Urinary levels of oxidative DNA damage products 
      8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) and 8,5'-cyclo-2'-deoxyadenosines (S-cdA, 
      R-cdA) were determined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with 
      isotope-dilution. In the first trimester, urinary 8-OH-dG levels were found higher 
      in the GDM group (n = 33) than in the control group (n = 84) (p = 0.006). R-cdA and 
      S-cdA levels were not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.794 and 
      p = 0.792 respectively). When the cases were stratified according to their first 
      trimester ferritin levels, women with ≥50th centile (≥130 ng/mL) demonstrated higher 
      levels of 8-OH-dG and R-cdA than those under <50th centile (p = 0.034, p = 0.009). 
      In the GDM group, there was a positive correlation between the second trimester 
      8-OH-dG and ferritin and 1st-hour glucose levels (p = 0.014, p = 0.020). This is the 
      first study where oxidative DNA damage is evaluated in both early and late periods 
      of pregnancy. Our findings reveal an association between GDM and iron status and 
      oxidative DNA damage.

TI  - Hemoglobin concentration and iron supplement during pregnancy were associated with 
      an increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hemoglobin (Hb) measurement is a conventional test during perinatal 
      visits. Hb concentration is related to iron supplement. However, studies focusing on 
      Hb levels, iron supplement, and pregnancy outcomes are scarce. This study aimed to 
      determine whether Hb levels and iron supplement were associated with the risk of 
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: A running hospital-based cohort was 
      conducted from August, 2011. The demographic data and medical information were 
      collected individually through questionnaires and patient medical records. Multiple 
      linear regression was applied for the association between Hb levels, iron 
      supplement, and blood glucose. Multiple logistic regression was used for evaluating 
      odds ratios between Hb levels, iron supplement, and GDM. RESULTS: Hb levels during 
      first (T1) and second trimester (T2) of pregnancy were significantly and positively 
      associated with blood glucose and GDM risk. After adjusting for age, prepregnancy 
      body mass index, and other risk factors, pregnant women with Hb ≥ 11 g/dL and iron 
      supplement had higher postprandial blood glucose at 1 hour (Hb ≥ 11 g/dL in T2 and 
      iron supplement in T1: β = 0.860，P = <0.001; Hb ≥ 11 g/dL in T2 and iron supplement 
      in T2: β = 0.960，P < 0.001; Hb ≥ 11 g/dL in T1 and iron supplement in T2: β = 1.133, 
      P = 0.033) and GDM risks (odds ratio [OR] = 1.53, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
      1.05-2.24; OR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.13-3.35; OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.07-4.34, 
      respectively), compared with those with Hb < 11 g/dL and without iron supplement. 
      CONCLUSION: High Hb concentration and iron supplements without anemia increased 
      postprandial blood glucose and risks for GDM. It indicates that pregnant women with 
      good Hb levels should not be advised to take iron supplements during pregnancy.

TI  - Expression of Hepcidin and Ferroportin in the Placenta, and Ferritin and Transferrin 
      Receptor 1 Levels in Maternal and Umbilical Cord Blood in Pregnant Women with and 
      without Gestational Diabetes.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph13080766 [doi]
LID - 766
AB  - BACKGROUND: Regulation of iron transfer from mother to fetus via the placenta is not 
      fully understood and the relationship between stored iron status in the mothers' 
      serum and gestational diabetes (GDM) in case-control studies is controversial. The 
      present study aimed to detect circulating soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and 
      ferritin levels in maternal and umbilical cord blood. We also examined the 
      expression of hepcidin (Hep), transferrin receptor (TfR1), and ferroportin (FPN) in 
      the placenta in pregnant women with and without GDM at full term. METHODS: 
      Eighty-two women participated (42 with GDM and 40 without GDM [controls]). Maternal 
      samples were collected at 37-39 weeks' gestation. Umbilical cord blood was collected 
      at birth. Ferritin and sTfR levels in maternal serum and umbilical cord blood, and 
      Hep, TfR1, and FPN protein expression in plac enta were compared between the GDM and 
      non-GDM groups. Serum ferritin (SF) was measured by electrochemiluminescence assay 
      and sTfR was measured by ELISA. Hep, TfR1, and FPN expression was measured by 
      immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Maternal serum sTfR levels were significantly 
      elevated in the GDM group compared with the non-GDM group (p = 0.003). SF levels in 
      cord blood in the GDM group were significantly higher than those in the non-GDM 
      group (p = 0.003). However, maternal hemoglobin and SF, and umbilical cord sTfR 
      levels were not different between the groups. In placental tissue, FPN expression 
      was higher and hepcidin expression was lower in the GDM group compared with the 
      non-GDM group (p = 0.000 and p = 0.044, respectively). There was no significant 
      difference in TfR1 between the groups (p = 0.898). CONCLUSIONS: Women with GDM 
      transport iron more actively than those without GDM at term pregnancy. Maternal iron 
      metabolism in GDM may play a role in fetal/placental iron demand and in the overall 
      outcome of pregnancy.

TI  - Gestational diabetes mellitus affects placental iron homeostasis: Mechanism and 
      clinical implications.
PG  - 7311-7329
LID - 10.1096/fj.201903054R [doi]
AB  - Clinical studies suggest that pregnant women with elevated iron levels are more 
      vulnerable to develop gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), but the causes and 
      underlying mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that hyperglycemia induces 
      cellular stress responses leading to dysregulated placental iron homeostasis. Hence, 
      we compared the expression of genes/proteins involved in iron homeostasis in 
      placentae from GDM and healthy pregnancies (n = 11 each). RT-qPCR and LC-MS/MS 
      analyses revealed differential regulation of iron transporters/receptors 
      (DMT1/FPN1/ZIP8/TfR1), iron sensors (IRP1), iron regulators (HEPC), and iron 
      oxidoreductases (HEPH/Zp). To identify the underlying mechanisms, we adapted BeWo 
      trophoblast cells to normoglycemic (N), hyperglycemic (H), and 
      hyperglycemic-hyperlipidemic (HL) conditions and assessed Fe(3+) -uptake, expression 
      patterns, and cellular pathways involving oxidative stress (OS), ER-stress, and 
      autophagy. H and HL induced alterations in cellular morphology, differential iron 
      transporter expression, and reduced Fe(3+) -uptake confirming the impact of 
      hyperglycemia on iron transport observed in GDM patients. Pathway analysis and 
      rescue experiments indicated that dysregulated OS and disturbed autophagy 
      processes contribute to the reduced placental iron transport under hyperglycemic 
      conditions. These adaptations could represent a protective mechanism preventing the 
      oxidative damage for both fetus and placenta caused by highly oxidative iron. In 
      pregnancies with risk for GDM, antioxidant treatment, and controlled iron 
      supplementation could help to balance placental OS levels protecting mother and 
      fetus from impaired iron homeostasis.

TI  - A longitudinal study of iron status during pregnancy and the risk of gestational 
      diabetes: findings from a prospective, multiracial cohort.
PG  - 249-257
LID - 10.1007/s00125-016-4149-3 [doi]
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to prospectively and longitudinally 
      investigate maternal iron status during early to mid-pregnancy, and subsequent risk 
      of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), using a comprehensive panel of conventional 
      and novel iron biomarkers. METHODS: A case-control study of 107 women with GDM and 
      214 controls (matched on age, race/ethnicity and gestational week during blood 
      collection) was conducted within the the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute 
      of Child Health and Human Development Fetal Growth Studies-Singleton Cohort 
      (2009-2013), a prospective and multiracial pregnancy cohort. Plasma hepcidin, 
      ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) were measured and sTfR:ferritin 
      ratio was derived, twice before GDM diagnosis (gestational weeks 10-14 and 15-26) 
      and at weeks 23-31 and 33-39. GDM diagnosis was ascertained from medical records. 
      Adjusted ORs (aORs) for GDM were estimated using conditional logistic regression 
      analysis, adjusting for demographics, prepregnancy BMI and other major risk factors. 
      RESULTS: Hepcidin concentrations during weeks 15-26 were 16% higher among women with 
      GDM vs controls (median 6.4 vs 5.5 ng/ml; p = 0.02 ), and were positively associated 
      with GDM risk; the aOR (95% CI) for highest vs lowest quartile was 2.61 (1.07, 
      6.36). Ferritin levels were also positively associated with GDM risk; the aOR (95% 
      CI) for highest vs lowest quartile was 2.43 (1.12, 5.28) at weeks 10-14 and 3.95 
      (1.38, 11.30) at weeks 15-26. The sTfR:ferritin ratio was inversely related to GDM 
      risk; the aOR (95% CI) for highest vs lowest quartile was 0.33 (0.14, 0.80) at weeks 
      10-14 and 0.15 (0.05, 0.48) at weeks 15-26. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our findings 
      suggest that elevated iron stores may be involved in the development of GDM from as 
      early as the first trimester. This raises potential concerns for the recommendation 
      of routine iron supplementation among iron-replete pregnant women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Exposure to cadmium may contribute to the risk of gestational diabetes 
      mellitus (GDM) and glucose intolerance during pregnancy. METHODS: We examined 917 
      women enrolled from 2009 to 2017 in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study. Lifestyle, 
      diet, demographic factors and pregnancy outcomes were collected by questionnaire and 
      medical record review. Cadmium concentrations were measured in urine samples 
      collected at 24-28 weeks gestation. Women were classified as normal (n = 815), 
      glucose intolerant (n = 86), or GDM (n = 16) based on clinical data (i.e., glucose 
      challenge test, oral glucose challenge test). We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% 
      confidence intervals (CI), adjusting for potential confounders, using multinomial 
      logistic regression to examine disease severity (normal, glucose intolerant, GDM) 
      and logistic regression to examine the combined outcome of gestational 
      hyperglycemia. RESULTS: Little to no association was observed for glucose 
      intolerance (OR = 1.11, 95%CI 0.85-1.45) or GDM (OR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.51-1.44) with a 
      doubling of urinary cadmium as compared to normal women. The combined outcome of 
      gestational hyperglycemia yielded similar results (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.84-1.35). 
      However, when stratified by pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), there was a slight 
      association with the combined outcome in normal weight women (OR = 1.32, 95% CI 
      0.88-1.98) and no association in the overweight or obese women. This positive 
      association remained in restricted analyses of only women with no exposure to 
      smoking during pregnancy and those who had never smoked. CONCLUSIONS: Cadmium 
      exposure was suggestively associated with increased risk of gestational 
      hyperglycemia among women not already at increased risk of GDM due to being 
      overweight or obese; however, associations of cadmium with gestational hyperglycemia 
      were not statistically significant.

AB  - In the present medical diagnostic method for the therapeutic of gestational diabetes 
      mellitus (GDM), it is problematic and difficult to release successful and secure 
      release of drugs to the exact site. Hence, many researchers have been carried out to 
      bring antidiabetic using modern method to release of drugs for their production. 
      This research work focusses on to provide an assemblage to the recent growth in the 
      field of Ramulus mori extract (RME) loaded on polyacrylic gold nanoparticle for 
      antidiabetics with special highlighting on nursing of GDM. Keynote of gold 
      nanoparticle: diabetes mellitus, nursing, insulin, antidiabetic, drugs, and new 
      system for drug delivery. Rat is used to test the drug delivery system. In vivo 
      examination was not prepared seldom including in this research paper. This research 
      investigation could be a new avenue for the development of drug delivery system of 
      GDM.

TI  - Association between maternal blood cadmium and lead concentrations and gestational 
      diabetes mellitus in the Japan Environment and Children's Study.
PG  - 209-217

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the association between elevated blood cadmium (Cd) and lead 
      (Pb) concentrations and increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). 
      METHODS: This cross-sectional study included pregnant women (n = 16,955) enrolled in 
      the Japan Environment and Children's Study. Concentrations of Cd and Pb in blood 
      samples collected at 22-28 weeks' gestation were measured by inductively coupled 
      plasma mass spectrometry. GDM was diagnosed according to the 2011 Japan Society of 
      Obstetrics and Gynecology and Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 
      criteria. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated 
      using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Blood Cd and Pb concentrations were 
      slightly higher among women with GDM than among those without GDM; however, these 
      differences were not statistically significant. Elevated blood Cd and Pb 
      concentrations were not associated with increased GDM risk in the nulliparous group 
      (Cd OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.28-2.08 for high vs low category; Pb OR 2.51; 95% CI 
      0.72-8.72) or the parous group (Cd OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.29-1.44; Pb OR 0.31; 95% CI 
      0.04-2.29). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that Cd and Pb exposure, in the 
      range of blood levels observed, has no significant relationship with the development 
      of GDM. Further prospective studies would be valuable to confirm these findings.

TI  - First Trimester Microelements and their Relationships with Pregnancy Outcomes and 
      Complications.
LID - 10.3390/nu12041108 [doi]
LID - 1108
AB  - Microelements involved in the oxidative balance have a significant impact on human 
      health, but their role in pregnancy are poorly studied. We examined the 
      relationships between first trimester levels of selenium (Se), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), 
      and copper (Cu), as well as maternal characteristics and pregnancy results. The data 
      came from a Polish prospective cohort of women in a single pregnancy without chronic 
      diseases. A group of 563 women who had a complete set of data, including serum 
      microelements in the 10-14th week was examined, and the following were found: 47 
      deliveries <37th week; 48 cases of birth weight <10th and 64 newborns >90th 
      percentile; 13 intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) cases; 105 gestational 
      hypertension (GH) and 15 preeclampsia (PE) cases; and 110 gestational diabetes 
      mellitus (GDM) cases. The microelements were quantified using mass spectrometry. The 
      average concentrations (and ranges) of the elements were as follows: Se: 60.75 µg/L 
      (40.91-125.54); Zn: 618.50 µg/L (394.04-3238.90); Cu: 1735.91 µg/L (883.61-3956.76); 
      and Fe: 1018.33 µg/L (217.55-2806.24). In the multivariate logistic regression, we 
      found that an increase in Se of 1 µg/L reduces the risk of GH by 6% (AOR = 0.94; p = 
      0.004), the risk of IUGR by 11% (AOR = 0.89; p = 0.013), and the risk of birth <34th 
      week by 7% (but close to the significance) (AOR = 0.93; p = 0.061). An increase in 
      Fe of 100 µg/L reduces the risk of PE by 27% (AOR = 0.73; p = 0.009). In the 
      multivariable linear regression, we found negative strong associations between 
      prepregnancy BMI, Se (β = -0.130; p = 0.002), and Fe (β = -0.164; p < 0.0001), but 
      positive associations with Cu (β = 0.320; p < 0.000001). The relationships between 
      Se and maternal age (β = 0.167; p < 0.0001), Se and smoking (β = -0.106; p = 0.011) 
      and Cu, and gestational age from the 10-14th week (β = 0.142; p < 0.001) were also 
      found. Secondary education was associated with Zn (β = 0.132; p = 0.004) and higher 
      education was associated with Cu (β = -0.102; p = 0.023). A higher financial status 
      was associated with Fe (β = 0.195; p = 0.005). Other relationships were 
      statistically insignificant. Further research is needed to clarify relationships 
      between first trimester microelements and pregnancy complications. In addition, 
      attention should be paid to lifestyle-related and socioeconomic factors that affect 
      microelement levels.

TI  - Plasma Concentrations of Ferritin in Early Pregnancy Are Associated with Risk of 
      Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in Women in the Danish National Birth Cohort.
PG  - 1756-61
LID - 10.3945/jn.115.227793 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence from experimental studies has demonstrated that higher than 
      normal iron concentrations can lead to pancreatic β cell dysfunction and impaired 
      glucose metabolism. Studies on body iron stores in early pregnancy and subsequent 
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk are sparse. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to 
      determine whether biomarkers of body iron stores measured in early pregnancy are 
      associated with GDM risk. METHODS: A case-control study of 350 GDM cases and 349 
      non-GDM controls was conducted in participants from the Danish National Birth 
      Cohort. Blood was collected at a mean ± SD gestational age of 9.4 ± 3.2 wk. Plasma 
      biomarkers of iron stores, including ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor 
      (sTfR), were measured. Logistic regression was used to estimate the OR of GDM 
      associated with quintiles of plasma biomarkers of body iron stores, controlling for 
      maternal age, family history of diabetes, exercise in pregnancy, parity, and 
      prepregnancy body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: Cases were older (mean ± SD age: 32.2 ± 
      4.3 compared with 29.9 ± 4.2 y) and had a higher BMI (in kg/m(2); mean ± SD: 28.7 ± 
      6.0 compared with 24.1 ± 4.6) than controls. Plasma concentrations of both ferritin 
      and sTfR in early pregnancy were significantly higher in GDM cases than in controls 
      [means ± SDs: 80.6 ± 56.0 compared with 71.8 ± 50.1 μg/L (P = 0.03) and 1.5 ± 0.7 
      compared with 1.4 ± 0.6 mg/L (P = 0.002) for ferritin and sTfR, respectively]. 
      Ferritin was positively and significantly associated with GDM risk even after 
      adjustment for major risk factors of GDM, including prepregnancy BMI. ORs across 
      increasing quintiles of ferritin were 1.00 (reference), 1.25 (95% CI: 0.70, 2.22), 
      1.89 (95% CI: 1.06, 3.37), 0.82 (95% CI: 0.46, 1.48), and 2.34 (95% CI: 1.30, 4.21) 
      (P-linear trend = 0.02). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that plasma ferritin 
      measured in early pregnancy is significantly and positively associated with GDM 
      risk.

TI  - Pregnancy complications effect on the nickel content in maternal blood, placenta 
      blood and umbilical cord blood during pregnancy.
PG  - 8340-8348

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nickel (Ni) may accumulate in the human body and has biological toxicity 
      and carcinogenicity. Ni has an extensive impact on the health of pregnant women and 
      fetuses during gestation. AIM: To evaluate Ni exposure in pregnant women in Kunming, 
      Yunnan Province, China; to describe the distribution of Ni in the maternal-fetal 
      system and placental barrier function; and to investigate the effect of Ni exposure 
      on fetal health in mothers with pregnancy complications. METHODS: Seventy-two 
      pregnant women were selected using a case-control design. The women were divided 
      into two groups: The control group (no disease; n = 29) and the disease group 
      [gestational diabetes (GDM), hypertensive disorder complicating pregnancy (HDCP), or 
      both; n = 43]. The pregnant women in the disease group were further divided as 
      follows: 14 cases with GDM (GDM group), 13 cases with HDCP (HDCP group) and 16 cases 
      with both GDM and HDCP (disease combination group). Basic information on the 
      pregnant women was collected by questionnaire survey. Maternal blood, placenta blood 
      and cord blood were collected immediately after delivery. The Ni content in paired 
      samples was determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. RESULTS: 
      Compared to the control group, age was higher and body mass index was greater in 
      pregnant women in the disease groups (28.14 ± 2.54 vs 28.42 ± 13.89, P < 0.05; 25.90 
      ± 3.86 vs 31.49 ± 5.30, P < 0.05). The birth weights of newborns in the HDCP group 
      and the control group were significantly different (2.52 ± 0.74 vs 3.18 ± 0.41, P < 
      0.05). The content of Ni in umbilical cord blood in the entire disease group was 
      higher than that in the control group (0.10 ± 0.16 vs 0.05 ± 0.07, P < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: In the maternal-fetal system of women with pregnancy complications, the 
      barrier effect of the placenta against Ni is weakened, thus affecting healthy growth 
      of the fetus in the uterus.

AB  - High iron stores in pregnancy are essential in preventing negative outcomes for both 
      infants and mothers; however the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) might 
      also be increased. We intend to study the relationship between increased iron stores 
      in early pregnancy and the risk of glucose intolerance and GDM. This prospective, 
      observational, single-hospital study involved 104 non-anemic pregnant women, divided 
      into 4 groups based on the quartile values for ferritin at the first trimester of 
      pregnancy. All participants were screened for GDM with 75-g oral glucose tolerance 
      test (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks' gestation. We observed that ferritin levels at early 
      pregnancy were significantly correlated to glucose level after OGTT at 1-h and 2-h 
      (rho=0.21, p<0.05; rho=0.43, p<0.001 respectively). Furthermore, in the higher 
      quartile for ferritin (>38.8μg/L) glycemia at 2-h OGTT was significantly higher than 
      in the others quartiles (p=0.002). In multivariate regression analysis, serum 
      ferritin was a significant determinant of glycemia at 2-h OGTT. Although we did not 
      find a significant association in the incidence of GDM in women with higher serum 
      ferritin levels, probably in reason to the limit power of our study, our data 
      demonstrated that the role of iron excess is tightly involved in the pathogenesis of 
      glucose intolerance. We report for the first time that high ferritin values in early 
      pregnancy are predictors of impaired glucose tolerance in non-anemic women. 
      Individual iron supplementation should be evaluated in order to minimize glucose 
      impairment risk in women with high risk of diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency anaemia has been associated with higher HbA1c levels. 
      However, during and after iron supplementation there is a decrease in HbA1c results, 
      causing a misinterpretation. Our aim was to analyse the effect of iron 
      supplementation on HbA1c levels in nondiabetic pregnant women with and without 
      anaemia. METHODS: Pregnant women in prenatal care, without gestational diabetes 
      (GDM) or previous diabetes mellitus (DM) that performed an oral glucose tolerance 
      test (OGTT) in the third trimester of pregnancy were invited to participate. 
      Clinical and laboratorial analyses were performed, including standardized 
      questionnaire, OGTT, full blood count and HbA1c. RESULTS: A total of 231 pregnant 
      women without DM or GDM were included in the study. According to anaemia and/or iron 
      supplementation, we divided women in: no iron and no anaemia - Group 1 (N=86); no 
      iron and with anaemia - Group 2 (N=29); iron and no anaemia - Group 3 (N=87); iron 
      and anaemia - Group 4 (N=29). There was statistically a significant, although no 
      clinically relevant, difference between HbA1c values in pregnant women in Groups 1 
      and 4 [5.1±0.4% (32±4.4mmol/mol) and 4.8±0.3% (29±3.3mmol/mol), P<0.01; 
      respectively]. HbA1c values in pregnant women in Groups 1, 2 and 3 were similar, 
      independently of anaemia [5.1±0.4% (32±4.4mmol/mol); 5.0±0.4% (31±4.4mmol/mol) and 
      5.0±0.4% (31±4.4mmol/mol); p>0.05; respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: Iron supplementation 
      during pregnancy does not affect HbA1c levels and has no clinical impact in the 
      final interpretation of results in the absence of anaemia or presence of mild 
      anaemia. Interpreting HbA1c results in pregnant women during iron therapy and with 
      moderate or severe anaemia still requires caution.

AB  - Elevated circulating ferritin has been reported to increase the risk of gestational 
      diabetes mellitus (GDM). When high ferritin translates into high iron stores, iron 
      excess is also a condition leading to free radical damage. We aimed to evaluate the 
      relationship between oxidative stress (OS) induced by iron status and GDM risk in 
      non iron-supplemented pregnant women. METHODS: This was a pilot observational study 
      conducted on 93 non-anemic pregnant women. Iron status was assessed at the first 
      trimester of gestation. Blood sampling was done at 24-28 weeks' gestation for oral 
      glucose tolerance test (OGTT), insulin and biological markers of oxidative damage 
      tests. RESULTS: A significant increase in DNA damage was found in patients who 
      developed GDM. Women with elevated DNA damage had a six-fold increased risk of 
      developing GDM (Exp (B)=6.851, P=0.038; 95% CI [1.108-42.375]). The serum ferritin 
      levels at first trimester were significantly correlated to lipid peroxidation 
      (rho=0.24, p=0.012). The stratified analysis suggests that ferritin is a modifying 
      factor for the correlation of oxidative stress (OS) and glucose intolerance. 
      CONCLUSION: Moderate ferritin levels due to iron intake without iron-supplement, at 
      early pregnancy is a modifying factor for the correlation of oxidative damage and 
      glucose intolerance in pregnant women. Larger studies to evaluate the risk of food 
      iron intake induced increased oxidative damage in offspring are warranted to propose 
      nutrition advice regarding iron intake in women with a high risk of GDM.

PG  - 939-44
LID - 10.1007/s10995-014-1614-9 [doi]
AB  - To measure the impact of a "Preventive Letter" designed to encourage the return of 
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) mothers to follow up visit after delivery, in 
      the context of a worldwide concern about low return rates after delivery of these 
      patients. Mothers with GDM require medical evaluation and an oral glucose tolerance 
      test (OGTT) 6 weeks after delivery, in order to: [a] confirm remission of GDM and 
      [b] provide advice on the prevention of type 2 diabetes. In the year 2003 we 
      developed a "Preventive Letter", containing three aspects: [a] current treatment, 
      [b] suggested management during labor, and [c] a stapled laboratory order for OGTT 
      to be performed 6 weeks after delivery. The return rate after delivery was assessed 
      in two groups of GDM mothers: [a] "Without Preventive Letter" (n = 253), and "With 
      Preventive Letter" (n = 215). Both groups, similar with respect to age (33.0 ± 5.4 
      and 32.3 ± 4.9 years respectively, p = 0.166) and education time (14.9 ± 1.8 and 
      15.0 ± 1.8 years respectively, p = 0.494), showed a significant difference in the 
      1-year return rate after delivery, as assessed by the Kaplan-Meier test: 32.0 % for 
      the group "Without Preventive Letter", and 76.0 % for the group "With Preventive 
      Letter" (p < 0.001). The 1-year return rate after delivery of GDM mothers was 2.4 
      times higher in the group "With Preventive Letter" than in the group without it. We 
      believe that this low-cost approach could be useful in other institutions caring for 
      pregnant women with diabetes.

      nutritional guidelines.
PG  - 581-586

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Maintaining proper nutrition during pregnancy is crucial for pregnant 
      women and especially for who have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus 
      (T1DM) or who develop gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). MATERIAL AND METHODS: To 
      measure differences in vitamin and mineral intakes among women with normal 
      pregnancies, pregnant women with GDM, and pregnant women with pre-gestational T1DM; 
      and to assess the women's dietary intakes in comparison with Polish nutritional 
      guidelines. The analysis was conducted among 83 pregnant women (29 GDM patients, 26 
      T1DM patients and 28 normal pregnancy participants) from whom we collected seven-day 
      24-hour dietary records during the second part of their pregnancies. RESULTS: There 
      were no statistically significant differences observed for most of the vitamin and 
      mineral intakes across the three groups. However, we did observe a significant 
      difference in the vitamin C and calcium intakes between groups. The mean vitamin C 
      and calcium intakes were significantly higher in the control group than among the 
      diabetic patients. Insufficient dietary calcium intakes were found among 52.3% of 
      the GDM patients and 61.6% of the T1DM participants, while only 28.6% of the normal 
      pregnancy patients experienced a calcium deficiency. The highest incidence of 
      inadequate intake in each of the GDM, T1DM and control groups was observed for 
      vitamin D (100%, 100%, 100%), folate (97.7%, 100%, 100%), iron (97.7%, 100%, 100%), 
      and iodine (97.7%, 92.4%, 85.7%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Diet alone may not be 
      enough to provide adequate levels of vitamins and minerals for most micronutrients. 
      Supplement use reduces the risk of inadequate intake for many micronutrients, but 
      diet-related issues during pregnancy and pregnancy diagnosed with diabetes remain, 
      and they deserve to be addressed during public health interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of 
      prophylactic iron supplementation on the pregnancy outcome of nonanemic pregnant 
      women in a sample of Iranian population. METHODS: This non-randomized clinical trial 
      was conducted during a 2-year period in obstetrics clinics of Shiraz, southern Iran. 
      We included a sample of singleton pregnancies registered in our clinics. Those with 
      comorbidities were excluded. Serum ferritin was measured at baseline and 
      participants were classified accordingly: those with normal serum ferritin levels 
      (≥30 µg/dL) who received standard prophylactic iron supplementation during the 
      pregnancy (Group 1); those who had minor thalassemia and elevated serum ferritin 
      levels (≥30 µg/dL) who did not receive prophylactic iron supplementation or those 
      with normal ferritin levels (≥30 µg/dL) who refused to receive iron supplementation 
      due to gastrointestinal upset (Group 2); and those with iron deficiency anemia with 
      low serum ferritin levels (<30 µg/dL) who received standard iron supplementation 
      during pregnancy (Group 3). All the participants were followed to the delivery and 
      maternal and neonatal outcomes were recorded and compared between three study 
      groups. RESULTS: Overall we included 30 pregnant women in each group with mean age 
      of the participants was 28.66 ± 6.02 years. There was no significant difference 
      between three study groups regarding gestational age at delivery (p = 0.250), 
      birthweight (p = 0.893), Apgar at 1 (p = 0.532) and 5 (p = 0.590) minutes, and route 
      of delivery (p = 0.590). The overall rate of maternal complication of the pregnancy 
      was comparable between the three study groups (p = 0.188). However, those in group 
      1, had significantly higher rate of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) when 
      compared to other two groups (p = 0.038). CONCLUSION: Prophylactic iron 
      supplementation in pregnant women with normal ferritin levels is associated with 
      increased risk of GDM. Other pregnancy and neonatal outcomes are not affected by the 
      prophylactic iron supplementation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare serum vaspin level and mRNA and protein levels of vaspin in 
      adipose tissue in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and normal glucose 
      tolerance (NGR), along with the correlation between serum vaspin level with fasting 
      insulin (FINS), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and 
      birth-weight. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-seven women with GDM and 36 with NGR were 
      enrolled. Total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), fasting plasma 
      glucose (FPG), FINS and vaspin levels were measured. The mRNA and protein levels 
      were detected using RT-PCR and Western blot. Pearson correlation analysis (PCA) was 
      performed to reveal the correlation between serum vaspin level and FINS, HOMA-IR. 
      Spearman correlation analysis (SCA) was conducted to examine the association between 
      serum vaspin level and birth-weight. RESULTS: HDL-C level in GDM was lower than NGR 
      group (P<0.05), and there were no statistical differences in TC, TG, LDL-C, FPG, 
      FINS and HOMA-IR between the two groups. Serum vaspin level, mRNA and protein 
      expression levels of vaspin in GDM were higher than NGR group (P<0.05). Serum vaspin 
      level was not significantly correlated with FINS and HOMA-IR, but had a positive 
      correlation with birth-weight (P=0.023). CONCLUSION: Serum vaspin level cannot serve 
      as an independent predictor of IR. The increased serum vaspin level and increased 
      vaspin mRNA and protein expression in adipose tissues in GDM women indicate that 
      vaspin may be involved in the pathogenesis of GDM, but its exact mechanism needs 
      further study.

LID - 10.1080/14767058.2018.1481952 [doi]
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of zinc and vitamin E 
      cosupplementation on metabolic status and gene expression related to insulin and 
      lipid metabolism in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).Methods: 
      Fifty-four women, in the age range of 18-40 years, diagnosed with GDM were recruited 
      for this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects were 
      randomly allocated into two intervention groups to either taking 233 mg/day Zinc 
      Gluconate plus 400-IU/day vitamin E supplements or placebo (n = 27 each group) for 
      6 weeks. Gene expression related to insulin and lipid metabolism was evaluated in 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of women with GDM using RT-PCR 
      method.Results: Participants who received zinc plus vitamin E supplements had 
      significantly lower serum insulin levels (β = -3.81; 95% CI, -5.90, -1.72; 
      p = .001), homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (β = -0.96; 95% CI, 
      -1.54, -0.38; p = .002), serum total-cholesterol (β = -8.56; 95% CI, -16.69, -0.43; 
      p = .03) and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL)-cholesterol (β = -8.72; 95% 
      CI, -15.27, -2.16; p = .01), and higher quantitative insulin sensitivity check index 
      (β = 0.01; 95% CI, 0.005, 0.02; p = .007) compared with the placebo. Moreover, zinc 
      and vitamin E cosupplementation upregulated gene expression of peroxisome 
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ; p = .03) and low-density lipoprotein 
      receptor (LDLR; p = .04) compared with the placebo. Though, zinc and vitamin E 
      combination did not affect other metabolic parameters.Conclusions: Overall, zinc and 
      vitamin E cosupplementation for 6 weeks in women with GDM significantly improved 
      insulin metabolism, lipid profile, and the gene expression levels of PPAR-γ and 
      LDLR.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of supplemental iron intake (SII) in early 
      singleton pregnancy women with the risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus 
      (GDM) among Chinese population.This study included 259 singleton pregnancy 
      participants. Of those, 135 women underwent SII and were assigned to an intervention 
      group, while 124 participants received no SII and were assigned to a control group. 
      The outcome measurements consisted of the number of patients with GDM development, 
      the levels of hemoglobin (Hb) and ferritin, and the outcomes of infant at 
      delivery.No significant difference in the number of patients with GDM development 
      was found between 2 groups at delivery. However, when compared with control group, 
      subjects in the intervention group showed greater efficacy in delivery mode choice 
      of vaginal delivery (P = .04), and cesarean section (P = .01), as well as the 
      birthweight of infants (P < .01). Moreover, Hb and ferritin levels were also 
      significantly higher in the intervention group than those in the control group 
      (P < .01).The results of this retrospective study showed that SII may not increase 
      risk of developing GDM in singleton pregnancy women; and also may benefit both 
      pregnancy women and infants among Chinese population.

TI  - Chitosan and Laminarin as Alternatives to Copper for Plasmopara viticola Control: 
      Effect on Grape Amino Acid.
PG  - 7379-7386
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.7b02352 [doi]
AB  - Copper fungicide use is limited by the European regulation; therefore, new 
      strategies have been developed to prevent grapevine downy mildew (GDM). However, 
      there is poor information about their effects on grape amino acid composition. This 
      field trial aimed to evaluate the effect on grape amino acid composition of chitosan 
      and of a mixture of laminarin and Saccharomyces extracts (LamE), applied in 
      different strategies with copper hydroxide. The results showed that all the 
      treatments applied to grapevines decreased the concentration of several amino acids. 
      Moreover, treatments that have mostly decreased these compounds are those with 
      copper hydroxide, especially when applied individually. LamE applied individually or 
      alternately with copper hydroxide had the least negative effect on grape amino acid 
      content. These results provide further information about the negative effects of 
      copper on grape quality, which can be reduced when it is used in strategy with LamE 
      or chitosan in GDM control.

AB  - The current study was designed to determine the beneficial effects of zinc 
      supplementation on expressed levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 
      gamma (PPAR-γ) and glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) genes in newborns of women 
      with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed among 40 women with GDM. Patients 
      were randomly allocated to intake either 233 mg zinc gluconate (containing 30 mg 
      zinc) (n = 20) or a placebo (n = 20) for 6 weeks. PPAR-γ and GLUT1 mRNA levels were 
      quantified in umbilical cord blood of newborns of women with GDM. After 6 weeks of 
      intervention, the change in serum zinc levels was greater in women consuming zinc 
      than in the placebo group (+11.1 ± 13.4 vs. -4.8 ± 17.3 mg/dL, P = 0.002). 
      Quantitative results of RT-PCR demonstrated that compared with the placebo, zinc 
      supplementation resulted in a significant increase of expressed levels of PPAR-γ 
      mRNA (P < 0.001) and GLUT1 mRNA (P < 0.001) in umbilical cord blood of newborns of 
      women with GDM. Taken together, the current study demonstrated that zinc 
      supplementation for 6 weeks among GDM women increased the mRNA levels of PPAR-γ and 
      GLUT1 in their newborns compared with the placebo group.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The current study was designed to determine the beneficial effects of 
      zinc intake on biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and pregnancy outcomes 
      among pregnant women with gestational diabetes (GDM). METHODS: This randomized, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted among 50 women with 
      GDM. Patients were randomly allocated to intake either 233 mg zinc gluconate 
      (containing 30 mg zinc) (n=25) or a placebo (n=25) for 6 weeks. Fasting blood 
      samples were taken at the fist of the study and after 6 weeks of intervention to 
      quantify related variables. Newborn's weight, height, head circumference, Apgar 
      score, and hyperbilirubinemia were determined. RESULTS: The change in serum zinc 
      levels after 6 weeks of supplementation was greater in women consuming zinc than in 
      the placebo group (+8.5±13.5 vs. -3.6±16.2 mg/dL, P=0.006). Changes in serum high 
      sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (-110.1±1 475.5 vs. +1 137.8±2 429.2 ng/mL, 
      P=0.03) and plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) concentrations (+60.0±129.0 vs. 
      -28.4±81.4 mmol/L, P=0.006) were significantly different between the supplemented 
      women and placebo group. We did not find any significant effect of zinc 
      administration on pregnancy outcomes. CONCLUSION: Taken together, zinc 
      administration among patients with GDM was associated with decreased hs-CRP and 
      increased TAC concentrations; however, it did not influence maternal plasma nitric 
      oxide (NO), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, or pregnancy outcomes.

      placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 565-570

AB  - To the best our knowledge, data on the effects of magnesium-zinc-calcium-vitamin D 
      co-supplementation on glycemic control and markers of cardiometabolic risk in 
      gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are scarce. The purpose of this study was to 
      establish the effects of magnesium-zinc-calcium-vitamin D co-supplementation on 
      glycemic control and markers of cardiometabolic risk of GDM patients. Sixty patients 
      with GDM, aged 18-40 years, were randomized into 2 groups to intake either 
      magnesium-zinc-calcium-vitamin D co-supplements or placebo (n = 30 each group) for 6 
      weeks in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Fasting blood samples 
      were taken at baseline and week 6 to quantify related markers. After the 6-week 
      intervention, compared with the placebo, magnesium-zinc-calcium-vitamin D 
      co-supplementation resulted in significant reductions in fasting plasma glucose 
      (-0.37 ± 0.09 vs. +0.01 ± 0.09 mmol/L, P = 0.003), serum insulin levels (-21.0 ± 4.8 
      vs. +7.2 ± 4.8 pmol/L, P < 0.001), homeostatic model of assessment for insulin 
      resistance (-1.0 ± 1.1 vs. +0.3 ± 1.3, P < 0.001), and a significant increase in 
      quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (+0.02 ± 0.03 vs. -0.002 ± 0.03, P = 
      0.003). In addition, magnesium-zinc-calcium-vitamin D co-supplementation 
      significantly decreased serum triglycerides (-0.25 ± 0.10 vs. +0.34 ± 0.10 mmol/L, P 
      = 0.001) and very-low-density-cholesterol concentrations (-0.11 ± 0.04 vs. +0.15 ± 
      0.04 mmol/L, P = 0.001) compared with the placebo. Overall, the results of this 
      study demonstrated that magnesium-zinc-calcium-vitamin D co-supplementation for 6 
      weeks among patients with GDM had beneficial effects on glycemic control and few 
      markers of cardiometabolic risk.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To the best of our knowledge, no reports are available indicating the 
      effects of zinc supplementation on metabolic status in women with gestational 
      diabetes (GDM). This study was designed to determine the effects of zinc 
      supplementation on glucose homeostasis parameters and lipid concentrations in GDM 
      women. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was 
      performed among 58 women diagnosed with GDM, primigravida and aged 18-40years old. 
      Patients were randomly divided into two groups to receive 233mg zinc gluconate 
      (containing 30mg zinc) supplements (n=29) or placebo (n=29) per day for 6weeks. 
      Fasting blood samples were taken at the beginning and end of the trial to quantify 
      glucose, insulin and lipid concentrations. RESULTS: Patients who received zinc 
      supplements had significantly higher serum zinc concentrations (+6.9±13.2 vs. 
      -1.5±16.5mg/dL, P=0.03) than those received the placebo. In addition, 
      zinc-supplemented patients had reduced fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (-6.6±11.2 vs. 
      +0.6±6.7mg/dL, P=0.005), serum insulin levels (-1.3±6.6 vs. +6.6±12.2μIU/mL, 
      P=0.003), homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (-0.5±1.6 vs. 
      +1.5±2.7, P=0.001), homeostatic model assessment-Beta cell function (HOMA-B) 
      (-0.7±25.0 vs. +26.5±49.5, P=0.01) and increased quantitative insulin sensitivity 
      check index (QUICKI) (+0.01±0.01 vs. -0.01±0.02, P=0.004) compared with the placebo. 
      Additionally, significant differences in serum triglycerides (+13.6±61.4 vs. 
      +45.9±36.5mg/dL, P=0.01) and VLDL-cholesterol concentrations (+2.7±12.3 vs. 
      +9.2±7.3mg/dL, P=0.01) were observed following the administration of zinc 
      supplements compared with the placebo.We did not observe any significant effects of 
      taking zinc supplements on other lipid profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, 30mg 
      zinc supplementation per day for 6weeks among GDM women had beneficial effects on 
      metabolic profiles.

AB  - CONTEXT: Zinc-α2-Glycoprotein (ZAG) is an adipokine with lipolytic action and is 
      positively associated with adiponectin in adipose tissue. We hypothesize that ZAG 
      may be related with hydrocarbonate metabolism disturbances observed in gestational 
      diabetes mellitus (GDM). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze serum ZAG 
      concentration and its relationship with carbohydrate metabolism in pregnant women 
      and its influence on fetal growth. DESIGN: 207 pregnant women (130 with normal 
      glucose tolerance (NGT) and 77 with GDM) recruited in the early third trimester and 
      their offspring were studied. Cord blood was obtained at delivery and neonatal 
      anthropometry was assessed in the first 48 hours. ZAG was determined in maternal 
      serum and cord blood. RESULTS: ZAG concentration was lower in cord blood than in 
      maternal serum, but similar concentration was observed in NGT and GDM pregnant 
      women. Also similar levels were found between offspring of NGT and GDM women. In the 
      bivariate analysis, maternal ZAG (mZAG) was positively correlated with adiponectin 
      and HDL cholesterol, and negatively correlated with insulin and triglyceride 
      concentrations, and HOMA index. On the other hand, cord blood ZAG (cbZAG) was 
      positively correlated with fat-free mass, birth weight and gestational age at 
      delivery. After adjusting for confounding variables, gestational age at delivery and 
      HDL cholesterol emerged as the sole determinants of cord blood ZAG and maternal ZAG 
      concentrations, respectively. CONCLUSION: mZAG was not associated with glucose 
      metabolism during pregnancy. ZAG concentration was lower in cord blood compared with 
      maternal serum. cbZAG was independently correlated with gestational age at delivery, 
      suggesting a role during the accelerated fetal growth during latter pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Maternal intake is crucial to pregnancy outcomes. Evidence shows that 
      both nutrient deficiency and excess can have adverse effects. In pregnancy, changes 
      in iron metabolism occur; therefore, dietary reference intakes increase to support 
      expansion of red cells and maternal-fetal transfer of iron. Appropriate and valid 
      assessment tools are required to investigate nutritional concerns in mothers with 
      and without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The objective of this study was to 
      assess the Willett food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to assess iron intake in women 
      with (n = 15) and without (n = 45) GDM. METHODS: To validate the modified FFQ, 
      estimated total iron intake during the third trimester was compared with biomarkers 
      of iron status such as serum ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and the 
      sTfR:F index at delivery. Data were tested for normality using the 
      D'Agostino-Pearson test. Differences between groups were tested using t tests or 
      Mann-Whitney tests. Correlations were tested using Spearman's ρ. Significance was 
      set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: Significant crude and energy-adjusted serum ferritin and 
      total iron intake were related (ρ = 0.30; P < 0.05) in women without GDM. Serum 
      ferritin, sTfR, and the sTfR:F index were different (P < 0.05) between women with 
      intakes above and below the recommended levels. Cross-classification showed 
      agreement between methods in mothers with and without GDM; on average, 63% of the 
      women were classified into the same or adjacent quartile when ranked by FFQ and iron 
      status. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest the Willett FFQ is a good tool for 
      assessing total iron intake of French-Canadian pregnant women.

TI  - Cobalamin Concentrations in Fetal Liver Show Gender Differences: A Result from Using 
      a High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography-Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry 
      as an Ultratrace Cobalt Speciation Method.
PG  - 12419-12426
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.6b03730 [doi]
AB  - Maternal diet and lifestyle choices may affect placental transfer of cobalamin (Cbl) 
      to the fetus. Fetal liver concentration of Cbl reflects nutritional status with 
      regards to vitamin B12, but at these low concentration current Cbl measurement 
      methods lack robustness. An analytical method based on enzymatic extraction with 
      subsequent reversed-phase-high-pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) separation 
      and parallel ICPMS and electrospray ionization (ESI)-Orbitrap-MS to determine 
      specifically Cbl species in liver samples of only 10-50 mg was developed using 14 
      pig livers. Subsequently 55 human fetal livers were analyzed. HPLC-ICPMS analysis 
      for cobalt (Co) and Cbl gave detection limits of 0.18 ng/g and 0.88 ng/g d.m. in 
      liver samples, respectively, with a recovery of >95%. Total Co (Co(t)) concentration 
      did not reflect the amount of Cbl or vitamin B12 in the liver. Cbl bound Co 
      contributes only 45 ± 15% to Co(t). XRF mapping and μXANES analysis confirmed the 
      occurrence of non-Cbl cobalt in pig liver hot spots indicating particular Co. No 
      correlations of total cobalt nor Cbl with fetal weight or weeks of gestation were 
      found for the human fetal livers. Although no gender difference could be identified 
      for total Co concentration, female livers were significantly higher in Cbl 
      concentration (24.1 ± 7.8 ng/g) than those from male fetuses (19.8 ± 7.1 ng/g) (p = 
      0.04). This HPLC-ICPMS method was able to quantify total Co(t) and Cbl in fetus 
      liver, and it was sensitive and precise enough to identify this gender difference.

TI  - Iron deficiency in early pregnancy using serum ferritin and soluble transferrin 
      receptor concentrations are associated with pregnancy and birth outcomes.
PG  - 358-63
LID - 10.1038/ejcn.2015.157 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: There are several biomarkers for measuring iron deficiency 
      (ID) in pregnancy, but the prevalence of ID and its association with inflammation 
      and adverse pregnancy outcomes is inconclusive. The aim of this work was to describe 
      the prevalence and determinants of first trimester ID and associations with 
      pregnancy and birth outcomes. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A record-linkage cohort study of 
      archived serum samples of women attending first trimester screening and birth and 
      hospital data to ascertain maternal characteristics and pregnancy outcomes. Sera 
      were analysed for iron stores (ferritin; μg/l), lack of iron in the tissues (soluble 
      transferrin receptor (sTfR); nmol/l) and inflammatory (C-reactive protein (CRP); 
      mg/dl) biomarkers. Total body iron (TBI) was calculated from serum ferritin (SF) and 
      sTfR concentrations. Multivariate logistic regression analysed risk factors and 
      pregnancy outcomes associated with ID using the definitions: SF<12 μg/l, TfR ⩾ 21.0 
      nmol/l, and TBI<0 mg/kg. RESULTS: Of the 4420 women, the prevalence of ID based on 
      ferritin, sTfR and TBI was 19.6, 15.3 and 15.7%, respectively. Risk factors of ID 
      varied depending on which iron parameter was used and included maternal age <25 
      years, multiparity, socioeconomic disadvantage, high maternal body weight and 
      inflammation. ID, defined by SF and TBI but not TfR, was associated with reduced 
      risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). ID defined using TBI only was 
      associated with increased risk of large-for-gestation-age (LGA) infants. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one in five Australian women begin pregnancy with ID. Further 
      investigation of excess maternal weight and inflammation in the relationships 
      between ID and GDM and LGA infants is needed.

TI  - Zinc-Associated Variant in SLC30A8 Gene Interacts With Gestational Weight Gain on 
      Postpartum Glycemic Changes: A Longitudinal Study in Women With Prior Gestational 
      Diabetes Mellitus.
PG  - 3786-3793
AB  - Zinc transporter 8 genetic variant SLC30A8 has been associated with postpartum risk 
      of type 2 diabetes among women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Gestational 
      weight gain is one of the strongest risk factors for postpartum hyperglycemia. We 
      assessed the interaction between type 2 diabetes-associated SLC30A8 rs13266634 and 
      gestational weight gain on 1-5 years of postpartum glycemic changes in 1,071 women 
      with prior GDM in a longitudinal study. Compared with gestation of 26-30 weeks, 
      postpartum levels of fasting glucose, oral glucose tolerance test 2-h glucose, and 
      hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) increased across rs13266634 TT, CT, and CC genotypes in 
      women with excessive gestational weight gain, whereas opposite genetic associations 
      were found in women with inadequate or adequate gestational weight gain. Postpartum 
      changes in fasting glucose per additional copy of the C allele were -0.18, -0.04, 
      and 0.12 mmol/L in women with inadequate, adequate, and excessive gestational weight 
      gain, respectively (P for interaction = 0.002). We also found similar interactions 
      for changes in 2-h glucose and HbA(1c) (P for interaction = 0.003 and 0.005, 
      respectively). Our data indicate that gestational weight gain may modify SLC30A8 
      variant on long-term glycemic changes, highlighting the importance of gestational 
      weight control in the prevention of postpartum hyperglycemia in women with GDM.

AB  - The fluorescence Stokes shift (FSS) response of Zn(II)-substituted cytochrome c 
      (ZnCytc) is transformed from a monotonic red-shifting response in water to a 
      bidirectional response with much slower time constants in the presence of low 
      concentrations of guanidinium (Gdm(+)) ions. The FSS response in water observed over 
      the 100 ps to 10 ns range has two exponential components with time constants of 135 
      ps and 1.6 ns that account for a total shift of 30 cm(-1), about one-half of the 
      solvation reorganization energy. In contrast, in the presence of only 0.25 M Gdm(+), 
      the FSS response initially shifts 21 cm(-1) to the blue with a 820 ps time constant 
      and then shifts 60 cm(-1) back to the red with a 3.5 ns time constant. The effect of 
      Gdm(+) on the FSS response effectively saturates at 1.0 M, well below the 1.75 M 
      midpoint of the two-state unfolding transition. These results establish that the FSS 
      response in ZnCytc includes a significant contribution from the surrounding 
      hydration shell, which assumes a perturbed hydrogen-bonding network owing to the 
      binding of Gdm(+) ions to the protein surface. The blue-shifting part of the FSS 
      response arises from a light-induced conformational change that expands the protein- 
      and solvent-derived cavity around the excited-state Zn(II) porphyrin. This non-polar 
      part of the solvation response is enhanced in the presence of Gdm(+) because the 
      protein/solvent surroundings of the Zn(II) porphyrin are effectively more flexible 
      than in water. The enhanced flexibility in the presence of Gdm(+) increases the 
      amplitudes and accordingly lengthens the correlation time scales for the protein and 
      hydration-shell fluctuations that contribute to the FSS response.

TI  - Assessment of the neurotoxic potential of exposure to 50Hz extremely low frequency 
      electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF) in naïve and chemically stressed PC12 cells.

AB  - Increasing exposure to extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF), 
      generated by power lines and electric appliances, raises concern about potential 
      adverse health effects of ELF-EMF. The central nervous system is expected to be 
      particularly vulnerable to ELF-EMF as its function strongly depends on electrical 
      excitability. We therefore investigated effects of acute (30min) and sub-chronic 
      (48h) exposure to 50Hz ELF-EMF on naïve and chemically stressed pheochromocytoma 
      (PC12) cells. The latter have higher levels of iron and/or reactive oxygen species 
      (ROS) and display increased vulnerability to environmental insults. Effects of 
      ELF-EMF on Ca(2+)-homeostasis, ROS production and membrane integrity were assessed 
      using Fura-2 single cell fluorescence microscopy, H2-DCFDA and CFDA assays, 
      respectively. Our data demonstrate that acute exposure of naïve PC12 cells to 50Hz 
      ELF-EMF up to 1000μT fails to affect basal or depolarization-evoked [Ca(2+)]i. 
      Moreover, sub-chronic ELF-EMF exposure up to 1000μT has no consistent effects on 
      Ca(2+)-homeostasis in naïve PC12 cells and does not affect ROS production and 
      membrane integrity. Notably, in chemically stressed PC12 cells both acute and 
      sub-chronic ELF-EMF exposure also failed to exert consistent effects on 
      Ca(2+)-homeostasis, ROS production and membrane integrity. Our combined findings 
      thus indicate that exposure to 50Hz ELF-EMF up to 1000μT, i.e. 10,000 times above 
      background exposure, does not induce neurotoxic effects in vitro, neither in naïve 
      nor in chemically stressed PC12 cells. Though our data require confirmation, e.g. in 
      developing neuronal cells in vitro or (developing) animals, it appears that the 
      neurotoxic risk of ELF-EMF exposure is limited.
